<li>红绿灯和潮汐车道的规划
<ul>
<li>考虑到车辆运输的图网络结构：各个路口为节点（红绿灯的存在、车辆基本在路口停留），以及道路作为连接各节点的边具有一定的承载上限（权重），以及各节点之间会因为红绿灯容纳或释放一部分车辆，实现车辆在各路口节点之间的传导。</li>
<li>目标：城市交通的通行效率（拥堵问题），主要取决于节点（路口车辆等待时长）和边（道路车流量影响通行速度）的相关属性。</li>
<li>规划：对红绿灯时长、频率（甚至根据历史的时序统计数据或者实时的车辆流量情况实时调整）等运营模式进行规划，以及对潮汐车道（即节点连向其他不同节点的“边”权重的调整）进行规划</li>
<li>分类：某大城市每天各时段的交通流量情况，时序尺度下各路口的拥挤程度和高峰时期的状况，对节点进行分类标记，以及由于车辆通勤一般存在一定的区间范围（上下班、以住所或公司为中心的周边通勤片区）可以联系各个城市功能片区进行道路及路口节点的聚类</li>
<li>预测：图根据交通网络的动态演化构建模型，对于拥堵或事故等异常事件，分析其在交通网络的传导规律，预测周边节点的车流量等相关数据的变化趋势，也可以为前面的规划提供服务。</li>
<li>待思考：车辆行驶轨迹和流量数据？</li>
<li><strong>但是目前暂时没有找到公开可使用的足量数据。</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>共享单车或新能源汽车充电桩的规划（放置点、停放区间）

    <a href="#%e7%a4%be%e4%ba%a4%e5%aa%92%e4%bb%8b" class="header-mark"></a>社交媒介</h3><ul>
<li>识别虚假信息和机器人账号
<ul>
<li>虚假信息一般很难做到标注识别，从直观角度考虑，一般个体鉴别信息真伪只能通过交叉引证和内容溯源，由此可以构建相关的图网络结构，而各个信息源一般所属的web端都有相应的信赖或权威性指标（主流的搜索引擎一般会给出网站的评级），一些账号型信源也可以通过设计相关指标（用户历史发言、如果是自媒体账号还可以捕获其关注量等数据）来分类，这里想到比较新的点是如何通过信息传播链路来阻断虚假信息（一方面是识别虚假信息，一方面是在什么节点进行权威信息的推送，可以提供最优的辟谣策略）
<ul>
<li>或者可以进行意见挖掘，对给定的议题，建立模型去分析主流的意见观点和他们的分布情况，甚至预测舆论的导向会如何变化。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>内容平台的交互和传播
<ul>
<li>对于视频创作者来说，如何打造一个爆款视频？内容平台有比较清晰的网络结构，视频的作者（粉丝量）、话题（标签、分区）、交互指标（点赞、收藏、转发、评论）、受众群体、平台曝光，特别是内容<strong>转发</strong>所构成的传导链路对视频的播放量增长有多大的意义。
<ul>
<li>难点：数据难以获取。最近特地去某互联网平台大厂做数据治理的实习，埋点数据很详细，但是数据安全管理很严格，不会公开。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>甚至可以研究某些学术领域的论文在<strong>引用</strong>上的传导关系，一篇高引论文是如何在学术合作网络中传导的，和论文作者本身的头衔、社会关系，或者与论文的关键词、标题、摘要以及引用者的相关属性之间有多大关联，哪些因素更加重要，不同的领域有什么差异，是否有可能基于论文本身、平台及其作者信息来预测论文的引用趋势，甚至对于具体的领域和研究内容，是否可以规划出相关的方案来提高论文的传播率。
<ul>
<li>数据相对容易获取，各个学术平台和知识库都比较透明，可以爬数据，但是直观上感觉没有很新鲜的结论。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>待思考：舆论传播/情感分析？节点属性如年龄、性别、地理位置等在社区演化过程中的演变，以及这些属性对社区结构和信息传播的影响。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="物联网" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#%e7%89%a9%e8%81%94%e7%bd%91" class="header-mark"></a>物联网</h3><ul>
<li>基于物联网设备生成的大量数据，可以分析设备之间的关联和通信模式，这里主要指智能家居等AIoT设备，目前国内智能家居的通信交互标准和生态链都做的比较齐全了。这里可以不需要引用现实的庞大数据集，而是针对各类智能家居（例如传感器设备、显示设备[电视、音箱、智慧屏、移动终端]）设计怎样通信更高效（因为存在蓝牙、WiFi以及一些私有协议，设备间的信息传导并不是完全中心化的）
<ul>

<ul>
<li>引文网络是由学术论文间相互引证关系而形成的一类特殊且重要的复杂网络。在引文网络的动态演化过程中，形成了其独特的拓扑结构特性和动力学特性。揭示引文网络拓扑结构形成的内在机制，定量刻画其动力学行为，研究网络演化过程中形成的重要节点的特性，对完善和丰富复杂网络研究理论，以及描述和评价科学发展过程有着积极的意义。</li>
<li>本文对这几个问题展开了深入研究：
<ul>
<li>首先，建立了<strong>引文网络宏观拓扑结构形成的内在演化机制</strong>。结合节点年龄带来的老化特性以及节点入度内含的动态引用特性，对引文网络无标度拓扑结构的形成机理进行探讨。分别提出了三种适合于真实引文网络的机制：文献年龄修正的优先连接机制、渐消记忆优先连接机制和短期记忆优先连接机制。三种机制从不同侧面刻画了引文网络的内在老化特性，反映了节点年龄对网络进化带来的影响，这一结论对推广研究其他进化复杂网络拓扑结构的形成具有重要的指导意义。</li>
<li>第二，提出了基于引文网络的<strong>动态演化探讨学科间知识传播现象</strong>的研究方法。通过将宏观的学科间的知识传播映射到微观的期刊文献间的互引关系，结合文献实际引用和被引用过程的机理分析，对衡量学科间知识传播特性的两个重要指标：学科间知识传播的强度和速度，进行量化，并分析指标随时间的演化，从而描述和评价学科间的知识传播特性，及对学科发展的影响。通过研究，建立起基于动态演化的引文网络研究学科间知识传播现象的研究方法。</li>
<li>第三，刻画了<strong>引文网络中不同度值节点的成长模式</strong>。以具有不同度值的节点为研究对象，结合引文网络赋予节点的各种信息，给出节点被引频次之后隐含的广泛的属性特征，构建节点的特征属性空间。从节点被引频次随时间演化带来的时间序列引文模式，及节点各属性在引文网络中分布而带来的特征空间引文模式两个角度，完成了对不同度值节点引文模式的对比分析，从而得到高被引文献的典型的成长模式特征。</li>
<li>第四，实现了引文网络中的重要节点—<strong>高被引文献的特征提取及预测建模</strong>。提取文献在发表后早期的引用特征作为文献的内容特征。</li>

<p>基于社区发现算法的复杂网络关键反应路线提取：在分子自由基尺寸上对化工过程建立准确的机理过程模型，是目前世界“分子炼油”发展的重要方向。分子炼油过程体系的复杂性主要来源于化学反应网络的耦合性和多尺度性，这对深入了解化工生产过程提出了挑战。对复杂化学反应网络进行关键信息挖掘与表达，有助于工程师深入理解化学反应过程机理，实现机理透明化。由于炼油炼化过程的复杂反应网络存在以关键反应物质为中心的模块化、社区化特征，本文采用Leiden社区发现算法，从介尺度上对蒸汽热裂解制乙烯的反应网络进行反应社区划分，并基于分子自由基尺度从简化后的反应社区提取出对应的关键反应路线，为宏观反应网络到微观物质的相互作用提供一种可解释性的桥梁，助力揭示物质转化过程的知识传递机制。</p>

<p><strong>填空</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>填空发现机经的时候比较晚了，离考试还有十天左右。最开始用的是陈琦基础24套，那个比较简单，全做完了，并且上面单词跟3000基本重合的。zw1600开始用PDF刷题后来发现kmf网站更好用，大概做完了所有的medium，一半的easy，和一点点的hard，感觉考试的时候遇到了四五道原题。</p>
<p>重点来了。填空是GRE最恶心的部分，理论上需要背大量（在GRE考试之外再也见不到的）单词。但填空也有蒙题技巧。首先，一些填空题的正确选项可能是比较简单的单词，这时候可以直接选你觉得对的；或者所有你认识的单词都觉得不对，那剩下的那（两）个不认识的单词就大概率是正确选项。如果上述两个策略都失效了，还有一种冒险性比较大的策略：众所周知一些英文词根词缀具有感情色彩。比如un-(e.g. unlikely)，a-(e.g. abandon)具有否定、负面的感情色彩。另一些则有肯定、正面的感情色彩。这时候可以根据词的感情色彩来匹配句子的感情色彩。另外，背单词从高频的开始背（一些机构会整理高频词，网上也有高频词），统计学不会骗人的。另外运气也很重要。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>阅读</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>早早发现自己根本读不懂，于是阅读几乎没准备，把拿分重心放到填空上了。加起来做了差不多十篇吧，打算考试的时候战略性放弃长阅读。最后考试的时候的确读不完，短阅读认真做长阅读直接瞎猜的。</p>
<p>GRE阅读比写作容易备考很多。因为阅读并没有那么多生僻单词。个人觉得阅读首先要通读全文，然后再做题，不能像雅思托福一样看题找答案。遇到不懂的单词先猜，猜不出来可以尝试直接去掉这个词再读全文。如果之前有过托福基础，做GRE阅读会更容易一些。选择题切记别想多，按最直接的选。并且一定要把选项全部看完。逻辑题也是如此，一定要搞清楚原文到底说的是啥，然后把选项依次带入验证。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>数学</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>备考初期，各个部分的题都做了差不多十个试试难度，后面发现填空做不完了再没管过，考试前一晚上临睡觉翻完了数学词汇。考试的时候感觉题目对中国学生来说真的小意思，不过要认真一点，做完之后好好检查，尽量别提前太早交。另外，记住那些常用的重要的词汇，比如直径半径分子分母等等。</p>
<p>基本裸考。数学的难度介于小学和初中数学之间，极少数涉及高中以上内容（比如正态分布）。因此做题主要就是仔细，考虑全面。可以看一些机构整理的专有名词表，防止看到单词不知道什么意思而丢分，例如我这次不知道range有极差的意思，看见题脑子空白了一段时间。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>作文</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>这个不做错误示范了，我两篇都写了刚400字，除了打字慢，还有根本想不出来该用什么论据。好像字数要到550才能拿到一个好看的分数？因为作文我已经准备二战了。</p>
<p>理工科对写作要求不太高，而且新GRE已经取消了argument只剩issue了。issue比较难写，是因为选题通常比较抽象，比如一些政治和哲学论点。我机构老师采取的策略是写大纲，个人感觉很有用。issue和托福写作还不一样，托福是可以用自己或者朋友的例子的，而GRE不行，需要列举一些“高级”的例子，或者直接理论论证。例子可以多积累一点，配合写大纲。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>模考</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote">
        <p>考前务必要熟悉流程，我在雷哥上做了一套，但没做几个题，但对于怎么看前面的检查和用计算器相对很熟悉了，很有必要！</p></blockquote>]]></description>

<li>在 kd 树中找出包含目标点 x 的叶结点：从根结点出发，递归地向下访问 kd 树。若目标点 x 当前维的坐标小于切分点的坐标，则移动到左子结点，否则移动到右子结点，直到子结点为叶结点为止。</li>

<li>如果“当前 k 近邻点集”的元素数量 &lt; k，则将该结点插入“当前 k 近邻点集”，并计算该结点到目标点 x 的距离;</li>
<li>如果“当前 k 近邻点集”的元素数量 = k，但该结点到目标点 x 的距离小于“当前 k 近邻点集”中最远 点到目标点 x 的距离，则将该结点插入“当前 k 近邻点集”，并删除原先的最远点。</li>
<li>检查另一子结点对应的区域是否与以目标点 x 为球心、以目标点 x 与“当前 k 近邻点集”中最远点的距离为半径的超球体相交。 如果相交，可能在另一个子结点对应的区域内存在距离目标点更近的点，移动到另一个子结点，接着，递归地进行 k 近邻搜索; 如果不相交，向上回退。</li>
</ul>

<li>当回退到根结点时，搜索结束(若此时“当前 k 近邻点集”中的元素不足 k 个，则需要访问另一半树的结点)。</li>
<li>最后的“当前 k 近邻点集”中的 k 个点即为 x 的 k 近邻点。</li>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>KNN算法于1948年由Cover和Hart提出。<br>
存在一个样本数据集合，也称作训练样本集，并且样本集中每个数据都存在标签，即我们知道样本集中每个数据与所属分类的对应关系。输入没有标签的新数据后，将新数据的每个特征与样本集中数据对应的特征进行比较，然后算法提取样本集中特征最相似数据（最近邻）的分类标签。一般来说，只选择样本数据集中前k个最相似的数据。k一般不大于20，最后，选择k个中出现次数最多的分类，作为新数据的分类。<br>&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>数值型数据是指具有数量意义的数据，可以进行数学运算和比较。这种数据通常表示为数字，例如年龄、温度、身高等。在机器学习中，数值型数据常用于回归分析和连续变量的预测。标称型数据则是指无序分类的数据，其中每个值代表一个类别而没有数量意义。标称型数据通常表示为符号或字符串，例如血型、性别、品种等。在机器学习中，标称型数据通常用于分类问题，其中算法需要将输入数据映射到预定义的类别或标签。<br>
k最近邻算法 (kNN) 适用于处理这两种类型的数据。对于数值型数据，它可以基于数值之间的距离进行分类；对于标称型数据，它可以根据邻近样本的标签进行投票，并将测试样本分类为获得最多投票的类别。因此，kNN 算法对于这两种数据类型都有较好的适用性。<br>
还有其他类型：<br>
顺序型数据：顺序型数据是一种具有顺序或等级关系的数据类型，其中数据值之间存在某种顺序关系，但没有明确的数值差异。例如，学历等级（如小学、初中、高中、大学等）可以被视为顺序型数据。<br>
时间序列数据：时间序列数据是按照时间顺序排列的数据集合，通常是在一系列连续时间点上收集的数据。例如，股票价格、天气数据、经济指标等都属于时间序列数据。<br>
区间型数据：区间型数据是指数据值表示某个范围内的值，而不是特定的数值。这种数据类型通常用于表示测量的范围。例如，温度范围、年龄段等可以被视为区间型数据。<br>
比率型数据：比率型数据是具有固定比例关系的数据类型，其中数据之间存在明确的比率关系。比率型数据具有绝对零点，可以进行比较和数学运算。例如，长度、重量、时间间隔等都属于比率型数据。<br>
文本数据：文本数据是指以自然语言形式表示的数据，通常包含语句、段落或文档。处理文本数据通常需要使用自然语言处理技术来提取、转换和分析文本信息。<br>&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>老师反馈：这里的表述并不严谨，模型需要通过交叉验证来确认参数 k&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>简单直观，非参数化：kNN 是一种非参数化方法，不对数据的分布做任何假设。因此，在处理复杂的数据集和未知的数据分布时，它通常具有很好的适应性。<br>
对异常值鲁棒：kNN 对异常值比较鲁棒，因为它基于周围数据点的多数投票来确定分类，可以减少异常值对结果的影响。<br>
适应多类别问题：kNN 能够很好地适应多类别分类问题，因为它可以通过投票的方式来确定一个实例所属的类别。<br>
但是对高维数据的处理效率较低，需要大量的存储空间和计算时间；在数据不平衡或噪声较多的情况下，它可能会产生较差的分类结果。<br>&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>计算成本高：kNN 算法需要计算每个测试点与所有训练点之间的距离，因此在处理大规模数据集时，计算成本会变得非常高。<br>
存储成本高：除了计算成本高外，kNN 算法还需要存储整个训练集，这对于大规模数据集来说会占用大量的存储空间。<br>
维度灾难：随着数据维度的增加，kNN 算法的性能可能会下降，因为在高维空间中，数据点之间的距离变得更加稀疏，导致算法的效率降低。<br>
数据不平衡问题：在处理数据不平衡或噪声较多的数据集时，kNN 算法可能会受到数据分布的影响，从而导致分类性能下降。<br>&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:7">
<p>近似误差是指模型用于近似真实关系的误差，通常表示模型与真实值之间的差异。<br>
估计误差是指使用样本数据估计整体数据集特征时产生的误差。在 kNN 中，估计误差通常与样本的选择和样本的分布有关。<br>
K值的减小：模型变得复杂，容易发生过拟合。相当于用较小的邻域中的训练实例进行预测，只有与输入实例较近的(相似的)训练实例才会对预测结果起作用，对噪声敏感，即预测结果会对近邻的实例点非常敏感。如果邻近的实例点恰巧是噪声，预测就会出错。换句话说，k 值的减小就意味着整体模型变得复杂，容易发生过拟合。<br>
K值的增大：就意味着整体的模型变得简单.产生更平滑的决策边界，但可能会忽略数据的局部特征。这时与输入实例较远的(不相似的)训练实例也会对预测起作用，使预测发生错误。k 值的增大就意味着整体的模型变得简单。<br>
k 值一般取一个比较小的数值。通常采用交叉验证法来选取最优的k 值。具体可以取部分训练集作为测试集，在不同取值条件下观察最优值。&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:8">
<p>特征空间中两个实例点的距离是两个实例点相似程度的反映。k 近邻模型的特征空间一般是 n 维实数向量空间 $R^n$，使用的距离是欧氏距离，但也可以是其他距离，如更一般的 $L_p$ 距离或 Minkowski 距离。&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:9">
<p>实现 k 近邻法时，主要考虑的问题是如何对训练数据进行快速 k 近邻搜索。这点在特征空间的维数大及训练数据容量大时尤其必要。k 近邻法最简单的实现方法是线性扫描。这时要计算输入实例与每一个训练实例的距离。当训练集很大时，计算非常耗时，这种方法是不可行的。为了提高k 近邻搜索的效率，可以考虑使用特殊的结构存储训练数据，以减少计算距离的次数。具体方法很多，下面介绍其中的 kd 树方法。<br>
使用 kd 树相比直接计算方法的主要好处在于它可以有效地减少计算量。kd 树是一种二叉树数据结构，它可以用于优化搜索算法，特别是在高维空间中。<br>
以下是 kd 树相对于直接计算方法的一些优势：<br>
降低搜索维度：kd 树能够将搜索范围缩小到与搜索点最近的局部区域，从而避免不必要的计算。<br>
提高搜索效率：在具有大量数据点的高维空间中，kd 树可以更快地定位最近邻居，因为它可以避免对所有数据点进行逐一比较。<br>
更少的存储需求：相对于直接计算方法，kd 树通常需要更少的存储空间，因为它可以通过二叉树结构有效地组织数据。<br>
支持范围搜索：除了最近邻搜索之外，kd 树还可以很容易地扩展到支持范围搜索，以查找在给定半径内的所有邻居。<br>
尽管 kd 树具有这些优势，但它可能会因数据的特定分布而表现不佳。例如，在存在大量密集聚集数据点的区域，kd 树的性能可能会下降。因此，在实际应用中，应该根据数据集的特点选择合适的算法来进行近邻搜索。&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:10">
<p>kd 树是一种对 k 维空间中的实例点进行存储以便对其进行快速检索的树形数据结构。kd 树是二叉树，表示对 k 维空间的一个划分。构造 kd 树相当于不断地用垂直于坐标轴的超平面将k 维空间切分，构成一系列的飞 维超矩形区域。kd树的每个结点对应于一个k 维超矩形区域。<br>
构造 kd 树的方法如下:构造根结点，使根结点对应于 k 维空间中包含所有实例点的超矩形区域:通过下面的递归方法，不断地对 k 维空间进行切分，生成子结点。在超矩形区域(结点)上选择一个坐标轴和在此坐标轴上的一个切分点，确定一个超平面，这个超平面通过选定的切分点并垂直于选定的坐标轴，将当前超矩形区域切分为左右两个子区域（子结点）；这时，实例被分到两个子区域。这个过程直到子区域内没有实例时终止（终止时的结点为叶结点）。在此过程中，将实例保存在相应的结点上。<br>
平衡树：使用中位数作为划分点可以保证树的相对平衡，避免出现极端情况下的不平衡树结构，从而使得搜索效率总体比较高，但未必最优。考虑一些离群点。&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:11">
<p>考虑特征之间的相关性：马氏距离能够考虑数据特征之间的相关性，而欧氏距离只考虑各个维度之间的直线距离。这意味着马氏距离在具有相关特征的数据集上能够提供更加准确的距离度量。<br>
对数据的缩放不敏感：在某些情况下，数据的不同特征可能具有不同的度量单位或尺度。马氏距离能够对数据的缩放不敏感，因此可以更好地处理这种情况，而欧氏距离可能受到数据尺度的影响。<br>
考虑协方差结构：马氏距离考虑了数据的协方差结构，因此可以更好地捕捉数据特征之间的线性关系。这使得马氏距离在处理多元正态分布数据时能够提供更加准确的距离度量。<br>
适用于异常值和噪声数据：马氏距离能够对异常值和噪声数据具有更好的鲁棒性，因为它考虑了数据的协方差结构，可以减少这些异常值对距离度量的影响。&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most interesting places in my country is the ancient city of Petra, located in the southern region of Jordan.</p>
<p>I first learned about Petra through history classes and documentaries. It&rsquo;s often referred to as the &ldquo;Rose City&rdquo; due to the pink-hued stone from which it is carved. What makes Petra truly special is its historical significance and unique architecture. It was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BC and later became a major trading hub.</p>
<p>The special features of Petra are its stunning rock-cut architecture and the intricate carvings and facades of its buildings. The most iconic structure is Al-Khazneh, also known as the Treasury, which is an elaborate temple facade carved directly into the rock face. As you explore further into Petra, you&rsquo;ll find countless tombs, temples, and other structures, all intricately carved into the rose-red cliffs.</p>
<p>What makes Petra interesting to me is the blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. The city&rsquo;s location in a narrow desert canyon adds to its mystique. The fact that it was lost to the Western world for centuries until its rediscovery in the 19th century adds an air of intrigue. Walking through the Siq, a narrow gorge that leads to the city, and witnessing the Treasury suddenly emerging from the rock is a breathtaking experience.</p>
<p>Petra is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but also one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It&rsquo;s a testament to human ingenuity and craftsmanship and a place where history comes alive. The blend of ancient civilization and stunning geological formations makes it a place of profound interest and beauty.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can people access travel information?
<ul>
<li>Travel information is accessible through various means, including travel websites, guidebooks, travel agencies, online forums, and mobile apps. People can also seek recommendations from friends and family who have traveled to specific destinations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do people have different personalities in different regions of your country?

</ul>
</li>
<li>What causes the differences between different regions of your country?
<ul>
<li>Differences between regions can be influenced by historical factors, geography, climate, cultural heritage, and social norms. Each region may have its own unique characteristics shaped by these factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it just youngsters who like to try new things, or do people of your parents&rsquo; age also like to try new things?
<ul>
<li>People of all ages can enjoy trying new things and embracing new experiences. Age is not necessarily a barrier to exploring new interests or activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is a great tourist destination also a good place to live?
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily. While a great tourist destination may offer beautiful scenery and attractions, living there can have different considerations such as job opportunities, cost of living, and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do people who go to live in small towns think these towns are more interesting than the big cities?
<ul>
<li>People who choose to live in small towns may appreciate the sense of community, slower pace of life, and natural surroundings that these areas offer. They may find these aspects more appealing than the hustle and bustle of big cities.</li>

<p>Someone I know who recently moved to a new place is my friend Sarah.</p>

<p><strong>What the new place is like:</strong> Sarah recently moved to a vibrant and bustling neighborhood in the heart of the city.

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between living alone and living with roommates?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Living alone entails having an entire living space to oneself, with no roommates or shared accommodations.

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;Is it beneficial for young people to live by themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Living by themselves can be beneficial for young people in terms of gaining independence, learning life skills, and experiencing personal growth.

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Besides cooking, are there any other skills that people need to learn if they live on their own?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;What kinds of people tend to live by themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>People who tend to live by themselves often include young adults seeking independence, individuals who prioritize privacy, professionals with busy schedules, and those who can afford the costs of independent living. It varies based on personal preferences and circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;How can parents and teachers help young people to live independently?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents and teachers can help young people by teaching life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and time management. Encouraging responsible decision-making, fostering self-reliance, and providing guidance on handling challenges can also prepare them for independent living.</li>

<p>I am particularly interested in learning more about the Renaissance period in European history.</p>
<p><strong>When it happened:</strong> The <strong>Renaissance</strong> period took place roughly between the 14th and 17th centuries, with its origins in Italy and subsequently spreading across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>What I know about it:</strong> I have a basic understanding of the Renaissance as a cultural and intellectual movement that marked a transition from the medieval to the modern era. During this period, there was a resurgence of interest in classical learning, arts, and sciences. Renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo produced masterpieces, and scholars made significant advancements in fields such as literature, astronomy, and mathematics. It was also a time of exploration, with voyages of discovery led by explorers like Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p><strong>Why I would like to learn more:</strong> I find the Renaissance period fascinating due to its profound impact on the course of human history. It was a time of creativity, innovation, and cultural transformation that laid the foundation for many aspects of the modern world, including art, science, literature, and exploration. I would like to delve deeper into this period to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the individuals, ideas, and events that shaped it and to appreciate its enduring influence on contemporary culture.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> &ldquo;Should everyone know history?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, knowing history is valuable as it helps individuals understand the context of the present, learn from past mistakes and achievements, and gain insights into the development of societies and cultures. While not everyone needs to be an expert historian, a basic knowledge of history is essential for informed citizenship and cultural awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;In what ways can children learn history?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Children can learn history through various means, including formal education in schools, reading history books, visiting museums and historical sites, watching documentaries, and engaging in discussions with parents or educators. Hands-on activities, reenactments, and interactive learning experiences can also make history more engaging for children.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;What are the differences between learning history from books and from videos?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning history from books and videos offers different experiences. Books provide in-depth written information, allowing readers to explore details and analyze historical events. Videos, on the other hand, offer visual and auditory elements, making history come to life through images, reenactments, and expert commentary. Both mediums have their merits, and the choice may depend on individual preferences and learning styles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Is it difficult to protect and preserve historic buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserving historic buildings can be challenging due to factors like aging, structural deterioration, environmental conditions, and changing land-use patterns. It often requires significant financial resources and expertise in architectural conservation and restoration. Additionally, striking a balance between preservation and accommodating modern needs can be a complex task.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;Who should be responsible for protecting historic buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The responsibility for protecting historic buildings typically falls on a combination of stakeholders, including governments, local authorities, historical preservation organizations, property owners, and the wider community. Collaboration among these parties is often necessary to ensure the preservation of culturally significant structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;Who should pay for the preservation of historic buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding for the preservation of historic buildings can come from various sources, including government grants, private donations, philanthropic organizations, and heritage tourism revenue. In some cases, property owners may bear some of the costs, but public and private partnerships are often essential to ensure the financial sustainability of preservation efforts.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a rather disappointing experience at a restaurant a few months ago, and I&rsquo;d like to share that with you.</p>
<p>It happened at a restaurant called &ldquo;TasteBites&rdquo; in the downtown area of my city. My friends and I decided to dine there because we had heard good things about their food. However, our experience didn&rsquo;t match our expectations.</p>
<p>First, the service was exceptionally slow. It took nearly 30 minutes for a server to take our orders, and the restaurant wasn&rsquo;t even crowded at that time. After placing our orders, we waited for over an hour for our food to arrive. When it finally did, the dishes were lukewarm at best, and it was clear they had been sitting for a while.</p>
<p>Moreover, the server seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the meal. We had to repeatedly ask for water, and when one of my friends requested a condiment, it was completely forgotten.</p>
<p>We decided to address the issue with the server, explaining our dissatisfaction with the slow service and the quality of the food. The server apologized and said there had been some kitchen delays that evening. To their credit, they offered to replace our lukewarm dishes with fresh ones, and they did so promptly. However, the overall experience had already been marred.</p>
<p>I felt quite disappointed and frustrated by the experience. While mistakes and delays can happen in any restaurant, it was the combination of slow service, inattentive staff, and lukewarm food that made this a particularly unpleasant dining experience. I expected more from a place with a good reputation.</p>
<p>Addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do most people respond to bad services?
<ul>
<li>Most people respond to bad services by expressing their concerns to the staff or management. This can include requesting refunds, replacements, or discounts. Some may also share their experiences on review platforms or social media to inform others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you think services are better now than in the past?
<ul>
<li>Service quality can vary widely across different establishments and regions. In some cases, advancements in technology and increased competition have led to improved services. However, the quality of service can still vary, and some businesses prioritize customer satisfaction more than others.</li>

<p>One happy experience from my childhood that I fondly remember is a family camping trip to a picturesque forest when I was about nine years old.</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> During the camping trip, my family and I set up a tent near a serene, crystal-clear lake surrounded by lush greenery. We spent our days hiking through the forest, swimming in the lake, and enjoying delicious campfire-cooked meals. One evening, we gathered around the campfire to tell stories and roast marshmallows, creating lasting memories.</p>

<p><strong>Why it was a happy experience:</strong> This childhood camping trip was a happy experience for several reasons. Firstly, it allowed me to connect with nature in a profound way. The forest was teeming with wildlife, and the sounds of birds and rustling leaves created a soothing and calming atmosphere. Secondly, spending quality time with family and friends around the campfire fostered a sense of togetherness and created lasting bonds. We laughed, told stories, and shared experiences that I still cherish to this day. Lastly, the sense of adventure and exploration awakened my curiosity and love for the outdoors, which has stayed with me throughout my life. This camping trip served as a reminder of the simple joys in life and the importance of being close to nature and loved ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I once spent a significant amount of time with my niece, who was about four years old at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Who this child was:</strong> My niece, let&rsquo;s call her Emily, is my sister&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>When you spent time with this child:</strong> This particular occasion happened during a family gathering for a holiday celebration. I had taken some time off work to be with my family.</p>
<p><strong>What you did together:</strong> Emily and I engaged in various activities throughout the day. We played board games, built a blanket fort in the living room, read children&rsquo;s books together, and even did some simple art and crafts. We also had a mini &ldquo;tea party&rdquo; with juice and snacks, complete with stuffed animal guests.</p>
<p><strong>Why you spent time with this child:</strong> I spent time with Emily because I wanted to bond with her and create positive memories. Family gatherings are a great opportunity to strengthen connections, especially with younger family members. I also wanted to give her parents a bit of a break and help entertain her during the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>How you felt about it:</strong> Spending time with Emily was a joyful and heartwarming experience. Her boundless energy, curiosity, and innocence were a refreshing reminder of the simple joys of childhood. I felt a deep sense of love and responsibility in being a positive influence in her life, and it was immensely rewarding to see her laughing, learning, and growing during our time together.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s address your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you think children should have a lot of toys?</strong> The quantity of toys is less important than the quality of playtime. A variety of toys can help stimulate creativity and learning, but it&rsquo;s essential to balance toys with other activities that encourage imagination and social interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Where do children usually play?</strong> Children play in various places, including parks, playgrounds, schools, at home, and with friends. The choice of location often depends on the child&rsquo;s age, interests, and available resources.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think there are too many rules for children to follow, whether at school or home?</strong> Rules are necessary for setting boundaries and teaching children values and discipline. However, it&rsquo;s essential to strike a balance between rules and allowing children to explore and learn from their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think children should follow all the rules?</strong> Children should follow essential rules that ensure their safety, well-being, and the well-being of others. However, parents and educators should also allow room for reasonable autonomy and decision-making to foster independence and responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think it&rsquo;s necessary for parents to make decisions for their children?</strong> Parents should make decisions that are in the best interests of their children, especially when it comes to health, education, and safety. However, as children grow, it&rsquo;s essential to involve them in decision-making to help them develop decision-making skills and independence.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think it is good for parents to help their children choose friends?</strong> Parents can provide guidance and teach their children about making good choices in friendships. However, it&rsquo;s important to strike a balance between guidance and allowing children to develop their social skills and make their own friends. Overly controlling parental involvement in friendships can be counterproductive.</li>

<p>I can certainly describe an occasion when I received incorrect information.</p>
<p><strong>When I got it:</strong> A few years ago, I was planning a trip to a foreign country for a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>How I got it:</strong> I got the incorrect information from an online travel forum. I was researching travel tips and local customs for the destination, and I came across a forum post that claimed a specific visa requirement for the country had changed.</p>
<p><strong>How I found it was incorrect:</strong> After reading the forum post, I decided to double-check the information by visiting the official website of the country&rsquo;s embassy. There, I found that the visa requirement had not changed, and the information on the forum was inaccurate.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s address your additional questions:</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between email and phone in terms of providing information?</strong> Email and phone are both communication tools, but they differ in terms of their format. Email provides a written record and can be asynchronous (not requiring an immediate response), while phone calls offer real-time verbal communication.</li>
<li><strong>Which do you think is the better way to provide information, by phone or by email?</strong> The choice between phone and email depends on the context and the preferences of the individuals involved. Email is often used for documentation and non-urgent communication, while phone calls can be more efficient for immediate or complex discussions.</li>
<li><strong>How do people determine the accuracy of information?</strong> People can determine the accuracy of information by cross-referencing multiple reliable sources, checking for citations and references, assessing the credibility of the author or source, and considering the context in which the information is presented.</li>
<li><strong>How do people make sure they&rsquo;re getting the right information?</strong> To ensure they are getting the right information, people should use critical thinking skills, verify facts from multiple trustworthy sources, and consider the expertise and bias of the sources. Additionally, seeking advice from experts or professionals in the relevant field can help confirm the accuracy of information.</li>

<p><strong>Where I was:</strong> One occasion when I lost my way was when I was visiting a large, unfamiliar city for the first time. I was in the downtown area, exploring the city&rsquo;s attractions.</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> While I was engrossed in exploring the city&rsquo;s landmarks and architecture, I took a few turns down side streets without paying close attention to my surroundings. Soon, I realized that I had lost my sense of direction, and nothing looked familiar. It was disorienting because I couldn&rsquo;t immediately identify any landmarks or street signs.</p>
<p><strong>How I felt:</strong> I felt a mixture of anxiety and frustration.

<p>I remember a car journey vividly that happened during the summer of 2018.</p>
<p><strong>When it happened:</strong> It was in the middle of July 2018 when this memorable car journey took place.</p>
<p><strong>Where you went:</strong> My friends and I decided to embark on a road trip from our hometown to the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia, USA. We had heard about the stunning scenery and hiking trails there, so it was an adventure we eagerly anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>What you did:</strong> During the journey, we explored the scenic byways of the Blue Ridge Parkway, which offered breathtaking views of the mountains and valleys below. We hiked along various trails, picnicked by serene streams, and visited overlooks that provided panoramic vistas. The evenings were spent around a campfire, sharing stories and enjoying the tranquility of the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Who you had the car journey with:</strong> I had the pleasure of sharing this car journey with three of my closest friends. We all shared a love for nature and adventure, which made the trip even more enjoyable. We took turns driving and navigating, ensuring a smooth and collaborative journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why you remember it well:</strong> This car journey is etched in my memory for several reasons. Firstly, the stunning natural beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains left a profound impact on me. The clear mountain air, lush forests, and scenic overlooks were unlike anything I had experienced before. Secondly, the trip strengthened the bonds of friendship with my companions. We shared not only the excitement of the adventure but also the responsibilities and challenges of traveling together. Lastly, it was a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Being in the midst of nature&rsquo;s grandeur allowed for introspection and a deep appreciation for the world&rsquo;s natural wonders.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What benefits does public transport bring to the world?</strong> Public transport provides numerous benefits, including reduced traffic congestion, lower carbon emissions, cost savings, increased mobility for people without cars, and decreased dependence on personal vehicles.</li>

In many countries, this is the legal age for obtaining a driver&rsquo;s license, and it&rsquo;s a common age for young adults to start learning to drive.</li>
<li><strong>What qualities does a driver need to have?</strong> A good driver should have qualities like attentiveness, patience, good judgment, adaptability to various road conditions, responsibility, and the ability to remain calm under pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think the government should make it a rule for people to use public transport?</strong> Mandating the use of public transport for everyone may not be practical or feasible in all situations. However, governments can encourage the use of public transport through incentives, improved infrastructure, and public awareness campaigns to reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Which jobs require people to be good at driving?</strong> Jobs that require good driving skills include delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi or rideshare drivers, bus drivers, and courier drivers, among others.</li>

<p>Certainly, I can describe an activity that made me feel tired:</p>
<p>It happened a few months ago during a hiking trip in a national park. My friends and I had decided to take a weekend getaway to enjoy nature and explore some beautiful trails.</p>
<p>The reason I took part in this activity was to unwind from the stresses of daily life and to reconnect with nature. I had been feeling overwhelmed with work and needed a break to rejuvenate.</p>
<p>The activity was a long day hike through rugged terrain. We started early in the morning and embarked on a challenging trail that led us through dense forests, steep ascents, and rocky terrain. It was a full-day adventure, and we covered a significant distance.</p>
<p>The hike made me feel tired primarily because of the physical exertion involved. The steep inclines and uneven terrain required a lot of effort to navigate. Carrying a backpack with supplies added to the physical strain. Additionally, we encountered unexpected weather changes, which made the hike even more demanding.</p>
<p>Despite the exhaustion, the experience was incredibly rewarding. The sense of accomplishment and the breathtaking views we encountered along the way made it all worth it. It was a great way to disconnect from technology and immerse myself in the natural world.</p>

</li>
<li>What are the differences between feeling tired after studying and after exercising?
<ul>
<li>Feeling tired after studying is often mental fatigue, whereas tiredness after exercising is physical fatigue. Both can be accompanied by a sense of accomplishment, but the sensations and recovery methods differ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can people solve the problem of old people easily getting tired?
<ul>
<li>To address fatigue in older individuals, it&rsquo;s important to promote a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, and sufficient rest. Consulting with healthcare professionals for personalized advice is also beneficial.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently watched a movie called &ldquo;The Lost Expedition&rdquo; just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Why I didn&rsquo;t like it:</strong> Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the movie. It had <strong>received a lot of hype and positive reviews</strong>, so I was excited to watch it. However, I found the plot to be convoluted and lacking in coherence. The <strong>character development</strong> was weak, and I <strong>struggled to</strong> connect with the protagonists. Additionally, the pacing of the movie felt uneven, with long stretches of slow-moving scenes followed by sudden, rushed action sequences. This made it challenging to stay engaged with the story.</p>
<p><strong>Why I decided to watch it:</strong> I decided to watch &ldquo;The Lost Expedition&rdquo; because it was marketed as a thrilling adventure film set in a remote jungle, which is a genre I typically enjoy. Moreover, it featured a talented cast, including some of my favorite actors, which further piqued my interest. The trailer and promotional materials also promised a captivating and mysterious storyline.</p>
<p><strong>Why I felt disappointed about it:</strong> I felt disappointed about the movie primarily because it didn&rsquo;t <strong>live up to my expectations</strong>. Given the positive reviews and the intriguing premise, I had anticipated an exciting and well-crafted adventure film. However, the movie&rsquo;s weak plot, lack of character depth, and uneven pacing left me feeling underwhelmed. It was particularly frustrating because I had high hopes for the film based on the initial buzz and marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> &ldquo;Do you believe movie reviews?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider movie reviews to be valuable sources of information when deciding which films to watch. However, I also believe that personal preferences play a significant role, and what one person enjoys, another may not. Therefore, I use movie reviews as a guideline but ultimately trust my own judgment when selecting movies to watch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;What are the different types of films in your country?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>In my country, there is a wide variety of film genres, including action, comedy, drama, romance, science fiction, horror, and documentary films. Additionally, regional cinema and independent films are gaining popularity, offering diverse storytelling and cultural perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;Are historical films popular in your country? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, historical films are quite popular in my country. They often provide a glimpse into our rich cultural heritage and history. People are interested in learning about past events, historical figures, and significant moments through the medium of film. These movies also have the potential to educate and inspire audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Do you think films with famous actors or actresses are more likely to become successful films?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>While famous actors and actresses can draw audiences to theaters, the success of a film ultimately depends on various factors, including its storyline, direction, and overall quality. A well-crafted film with a compelling narrative can succeed even without A-list actors, and vice versa. Star power can be a factor, but it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a film&rsquo;s success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;Why are Japanese animated films so popular?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese animated films, often referred to as anime, are popular worldwide due to their unique storytelling, stunning visuals, and diverse range of genres. Anime explores themes that appeal to audiences of all ages, from fantasy and science fiction to romance and drama. The artistry and creativity in Japanese animation also contribute to its global appeal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;Should the director pay a lot of money to famous actors?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The decision to pay a lot of money to famous actors depends on various factors, including the project&rsquo;s budget, the actor&rsquo;s contribution to the film, and their marketability. While star power can attract audiences, it&rsquo;s essential for directors and producers to balance the budget to ensure the overall quality of the film. Ultimately, the financial arrangements between directors and actors are negotiated based on industry standards and the unique circumstances of each project.</li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the good advertisements I&rsquo;ve come across and find useful is a television commercial that I saw during a prime-time show.</p>
<p>This advertisement was for a water-saving device designed to be installed in household faucets. The ad depicted a typical family in their daily routine, showing them using water for various purposes like washing dishes, brushing teeth, and watering plants. However, what made this commercial stand out was its emphasis on the importance of water conservation.</p>
<p>It showed how the water-saving device easily attaches to faucets and reduces water flow while maintaining adequate pressure. The ad compared the water usage before and after installing the device, highlighting significant savings in both water and money over time. It also conveyed a strong message about environmental responsibility, portraying the family as conscious of their impact on the planet.</p>
<p>I find this advertisement useful for several reasons. Firstly, it raises awareness about a critical issue – water conservation – in a clear and compelling way. It educates viewers about a simple and practical solution that they can implement in their homes to contribute to water preservation efforts. Secondly, it provides a practical and cost-effective solution that can benefit households by reducing water bills while also benefiting the environment.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel positively about this advertisement because it addresses an important global issue and offers a concrete solution that individuals can adopt. It motivates people to take action in a way that is both practical and environmentally responsible.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you think of online advertising?
<ul>
<li>Online advertising is a common and effective way for businesses to reach their target audience. It can be informative and engaging when done well, but excessive or intrusive online ads can be annoying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there any great online advertisements?
<ul>
<li>Yes, there are many great online advertisements that have gone viral and garnered widespread attention. These ads often combine creativity, humor, or a compelling message to engage viewers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do people usually buy?
<ul>
<li>People buy a wide range of products and services based on their needs, preferences, and lifestyles. Common purchases include food, clothing, electronics, housing, transportation, and entertainment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why does buying new things make people happy?
<ul>
<li>Buying new things can make people happy because it often satisfies their desires, provides a sense of achievement, and can enhance their quality of life. However, the happiness from material possessions is typically temporary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do people watch useless advertisements in this day and age?
<ul>
<li>People generally try to avoid watching advertisements that they find irrelevant or uninteresting. Advertisers strive to create compelling and relevant content to capture viewers&rsquo; attention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you think there is too much advertising in our daily lives?
<ul>
<li>The level of advertising in daily life varies by location and media consumption. Some people may feel that there is an excessive amount of advertising, while others may not be bothered by it. Balancing the need for advertising with respecting consumers&rsquo; preferences is an ongoing challenge for marketers and regulators.</li>

<p>One game I thoroughly enjoyed playing when I was younger was &ldquo;Hide and Seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What the game was:</strong> Hide and Seek is a classic children&rsquo;s game where one person closes their eyes and counts to a predetermined number while the other participants hide. After counting, the seeker attempts to find the hidden players. When the seeker spots someone, they shout &ldquo;Ready or not, here I come!&rdquo; and the hidden player is found.</p>
<p><strong>Where I played it:</strong> We played Hide and Seek primarily in our neighborhood, which was filled with houses and yards, providing plenty of hiding spots. We also played it in local parks and during family gatherings at our grandparents&rsquo; house.</p>
<p><strong>Who I played it with:</strong> I played Hide and Seek with my neighborhood friends, schoolmates, and family members. It was a versatile game that could be enjoyed with both small and large groups of people.</p>
<p><strong>Why I enjoyed playing the game:</strong> I enjoyed Hide and Seek for several reasons. Firstly, it was a game that required creativity and strategy. Finding the perfect hiding spot involved thinking outside the box, and as a child, it was a fun challenge. Secondly, the game encouraged physical activity and outdoor play, which was both enjoyable and healthy. Running, hiding, and seeking added an element of excitement and adventure to our playtime. Lastly, Hide and Seek fostered strong social bonds and friendships. It provided an opportunity for us to bond, laugh, and share in the joy of discovery when someone was found. The game was a source of simple, innocent fun that brought our community of friends and family closer together.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;Are outdoor sports important for kids?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, outdoor sports are important for kids&rsquo; physical and social development. They promote physical fitness, teamwork, coordination, and social interaction. Outdoor activities also encourage a healthy lifestyle and provide an opportunity for kids to connect with nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Why do people play different games now than before?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The availability of new technologies and changing societal trends have influenced the types of games people play. Digital games and technology have introduced a wide range of options, and people&rsquo;s interests and preferences have evolved over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;Is winning important in games?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>While winning can add a competitive element to games, it&rsquo;s not always the primary focus. Many games are enjoyed for the fun, camaraderie, and learning experiences they offer. The importance of winning varies depending on the game and individual preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;Which is better, individual games or team-based games?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The preference for individual or team-based games is subjective and varies from person to person. Both types of games have their merits. Individual games may promote self-reliance and personal achievement, while team-based games emphasize collaboration, communication, and shared success. The choice often depends on personal interests and the desired experience.</li>

<p>One of the most beautiful cities I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of visiting is Prague, which is located in the Czech Republic. I first learned about Prague through travel documentaries and books, which showcased its rich history and architectural beauty.</p>
<p>Prague is renowned for its stunning architecture, including the Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and the Astronomical Clock. The cityscape is characterized by a blend of Gothic, Baroque, Romanesque, and Renaissance styles, giving it a unique and enchanting appearance.</p>
<p>What makes Prague truly famous is its historical significance and well-preserved medieval Old Town.

The city is also famous for its charming cobblestone streets, vibrant cultural scene, and delicious Czech cuisine.</p>
<p>Prague&rsquo;s beauty lies in its ability to transport you back in time. Walking through its ancient streets feels like stepping into a fairy tale. The architecture is awe-inspiring, the winding streets are full of hidden gems, and the Vltava River running through the city adds to its picturesque quality.

<p>One of the books I have read many times is &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; by Harper Lee.</p>
<p><strong>What the book is about:</strong> &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; is a classic novel set in the American South during the 1930s. It tells the story of Scout Finch, a young girl, and her brother Jem, as they grow up in a racially divided town. The book explores themes of racism, injustice, morality, and the loss of innocence, primarily through the lens of the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman.</p>
<p><strong>How often I have read this book:</strong> I have read &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; multiple times over the years, at least four or five times.</p>
<p><strong>Why I read it:</strong> I return to this book because of its powerful storytelling, compelling characters, and the depth of its themes. It offers a timeless exploration of societal issues that are sadly still relevant today, and each re-reading provides a fresh perspective and new insights.</p>
<p><strong>Effect the book has had on me:</strong> &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; has had a profound impact on me. It has made me more aware of issues related to justice, equality, and empathy. The character of Atticus Finch, the children&rsquo;s father, serves as a moral compass, and his unwavering commitment to doing what is right has inspired me to be a more principled and compassionate person. The book has reinforced the importance of standing up against injustice and prejudice, even in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s address your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What kinds of books do children like to read?

Books that spark their curiosity and capture their imagination tend to be the most appealing.</li>

Some people prefer the convenience of e-books, while others enjoy the tactile experience of printed books. Both formats have their merits.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think people need to develop the habit of reading? Why?</strong> Yes, developing the habit of reading is important because it fosters critical thinking, improves vocabulary, enhances empathy, and broadens one&rsquo;s knowledge. Reading is a lifelong skill that can bring both enjoyment and personal growth.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think reading books can make people happier?</strong> Reading can bring happiness by providing an escape, fostering a sense of connection with characters and stories, and offering insights into life&rsquo;s complexities. It can be a source of joy and solace for many.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think e-books will make people read more? Why?</strong> E-books have made reading more accessible and convenient for many people, but whether they make people read more depends on individual preferences. E-books have certainly expanded reading opportunities, but some still prefer the traditional experience of printed books. The impact of e-books on reading habits varies from person to person.</li>

<li>数据域：面向业务分析，将业务过程或维度进行抽象的集合。
<ul>
<li>业务过程：不可拆分的行为事件，可以定义指标，如买家下单事件</li>
<li>维度：度量环境，如买家是维度
为保障整个体系的生命力，数据域是需要抽象提炼，并且长期维护和更新的，但不轻易变动。在划分数据域时，既能涵盖当前所有的业务需求，又能在新业务进入时无影响地被包含进已有的数据域中和扩展新的数据域。</li>
