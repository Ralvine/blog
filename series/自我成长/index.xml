    <a href="#gre" class="header-mark"></a>GRE</h2><p><strong>单词</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote">
        <p>用的是kmf上的3000和1400以及zw的等价词和填空1600题生词伴侣（这个是把填空1600题的所有感觉有难度的词筛出来的表格）每天都花五六个小时记单词，大概是APP背累了再背PDF再背纸质书这样最后1400和等价词大概背了五遍，3000背了三遍，1600过了一遍的样子。最后考试的时候感觉大部分填空的单词都认识，做的也相对顺利。</p></blockquote> 

<p><strong>填空</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>填空发现机经的时候比较晚了，离考试还有十天左右。最开始用的是陈琦基础24套，那个比较简单，全做完了，并且上面单词跟3000基本重合的。zw1600开始用PDF刷题后来发现kmf网站更好用，大概做完了所有的medium，一半的easy，和一点点的hard，感觉考试的时候遇到了四五道原题。</p>
<p>重点来了。填空是GRE最恶心的部分，理论上需要背大量（在GRE考试之外再也见不到的）单词。但填空也有蒙题技巧。首先，一些填空题的正确选项可能是比较简单的单词，这时候可以直接选你觉得对的；或者所有你认识的单词都觉得不对，那剩下的那（两）个不认识的单词就大概率是正确选项。如果上述两个策略都失效了，还有一种冒险性比较大的策略：众所周知一些英文词根词缀具有感情色彩。比如un-(e.g. unlikely)，a-(e.g. abandon)具有否定、负面的感情色彩。另一些则有肯定、正面的感情色彩。这时候可以根据词的感情色彩来匹配句子的感情色彩。另外，背单词从高频的开始背（一些机构会整理高频词，网上也有高频词），统计学不会骗人的。另外运气也很重要。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>阅读</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>早早发现自己根本读不懂，于是阅读几乎没准备，把拿分重心放到填空上了。加起来做了差不多十篇吧，打算考试的时候战略性放弃长阅读。最后考试的时候的确读不完，短阅读认真做长阅读直接瞎猜的。</p>
<p>GRE阅读比写作容易备考很多。因为阅读并没有那么多生僻单词。个人觉得阅读首先要通读全文，然后再做题，不能像雅思托福一样看题找答案。遇到不懂的单词先猜，猜不出来可以尝试直接去掉这个词再读全文。如果之前有过托福基础，做GRE阅读会更容易一些。选择题切记别想多，按最直接的选。并且一定要把选项全部看完。逻辑题也是如此，一定要搞清楚原文到底说的是啥，然后把选项依次带入验证。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>数学</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>备考初期，各个部分的题都做了差不多十个试试难度，后面发现填空做不完了再没管过，考试前一晚上临睡觉翻完了数学词汇。考试的时候感觉题目对中国学生来说真的小意思，不过要认真一点，做完之后好好检查，尽量别提前太早交。另外，记住那些常用的重要的词汇，比如直径半径分子分母等等。</p>
<p>基本裸考。数学的难度介于小学和初中数学之间，极少数涉及高中以上内容（比如正态分布）。因此做题主要就是仔细，考虑全面。可以看一些机构整理的专有名词表，防止看到单词不知道什么意思而丢分，例如我这次不知道range有极差的意思，看见题脑子空白了一段时间。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>作文</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>这个不做错误示范了，我两篇都写了刚400字，除了打字慢，还有根本想不出来该用什么论据。好像字数要到550才能拿到一个好看的分数？因为作文我已经准备二战了。</p>
<p>理工科对写作要求不太高，而且新GRE已经取消了argument只剩issue了。issue比较难写，是因为选题通常比较抽象，比如一些政治和哲学论点。我机构老师采取的策略是写大纲，个人感觉很有用。issue和托福写作还不一样，托福是可以用自己或者朋友的例子的，而GRE不行，需要列举一些“高级”的例子，或者直接理论论证。例子可以多积累一点，配合写大纲。</p>
</blockquote> 

<p><strong>模考</strong></p>


<blockquote class="quote">
        <p>考前务必要熟悉流程，我在雷哥上做了一套，但没做几个题，但对于怎么看前面的检查和用计算器相对很熟悉了，很有必要！</p></blockquote>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Inc. He&rsquo;s a person I haven&rsquo;t met in person but find incredibly interesting and would like to know more about.</p>
<p>I came to know about Elon Musk through the media, primarily news articles, documentaries, and interviews. His name frequently appears in discussions about space exploration, electric vehicles, and innovative technologies.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has done many remarkable things. He co-founded Zip2, an early web mapping company, which was one of his first entrepreneurial ventures. Later, he played a pivotal role in founding PayPal, which revolutionized online payments. Musk&rsquo;s current ventures, SpaceX and Tesla, are groundbreaking in their own right. SpaceX aims to make space travel more accessible and has achieved milestones like reusable rocket technology. Tesla is a leader in electric vehicles, advancing sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>What intrigues me about Elon Musk is his relentless pursuit of ambitious goals. He is unafraid to tackle some of the most challenging and audacious projects in the world, often pushing the boundaries of what is possible. I&rsquo;d like to know more about his thought process, his approach to problem-solving, and his views on the future of technology and space exploration.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there any differences in the relationship between you and your friends and between you and other people?

<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Can clothing tell and reveal a person&rsquo;s personality?
<ul>
<li>Clothing can sometimes provide insights into a person&rsquo;s personality, style preferences, and interests. However, it&rsquo;s just one aspect of a person&rsquo;s identity, and judgments based solely on clothing may not always be accurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do individuals from the same family have different personalities?
<ul>
<li>Individuals from the same family can have different personalities due to a combination of genetic factors, upbringing, life experiences, and personal choices. Each person&rsquo;s unique combination of these factors contributes to their individuality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does society influence a person&rsquo;s personality?
<ul>

<p>One place I plan to travel to in the future, which is far away from my home, is Kyoto, Japan.</p>

<p><strong>When I would like to go:</strong> I would love to visit Kyoto during the spring season, specifically in April when the cherry blossoms (sakura) are in full bloom. This is one of the most picturesque times to experience the city&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
<p><strong>How I would like to go there:</strong> I would prefer to travel to Kyoto by air, taking a flight from my home country to a major Japanese city like Tokyo or Osaka, and then connecting to a domestic flight or train to reach Kyoto. The efficient Japanese rail system is a great way to explore the country.</p>

I&rsquo;d visit historic temples and shrines such as Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion) and Fushimi Inari Taisha, famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates.

Additionally, I&rsquo;m intrigued by the concept of wabi-sabi, which embodies the beauty of imperfection and transience, and Kyoto is a place where this philosophy is deeply ingrained in its culture and aesthetics. Overall, Kyoto represents a perfect blend of cultural exploration and natural wonder, making it a destination I&rsquo;m eager to visit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most interesting places in my country is the ancient city of Petra, located in the southern region of Jordan.</p>
<p>I first learned about Petra through history classes and documentaries. It&rsquo;s often referred to as the &ldquo;Rose City&rdquo; due to the pink-hued stone from which it is carved. What makes Petra truly special is its historical significance and unique architecture. It was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BC and later became a major trading hub.</p>
<p>The special features of Petra are its stunning rock-cut architecture and the intricate carvings and facades of its buildings. The most iconic structure is Al-Khazneh, also known as the Treasury, which is an elaborate temple facade carved directly into the rock face. As you explore further into Petra, you&rsquo;ll find countless tombs, temples, and other structures, all intricately carved into the rose-red cliffs.</p>
<p>What makes Petra interesting to me is the blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. The city&rsquo;s location in a narrow desert canyon adds to its mystique. The fact that it was lost to the Western world for centuries until its rediscovery in the 19th century adds an air of intrigue. Walking through the Siq, a narrow gorge that leads to the city, and witnessing the Treasury suddenly emerging from the rock is a breathtaking experience.</p>
<p>Petra is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but also one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It&rsquo;s a testament to human ingenuity and craftsmanship and a place where history comes alive. The blend of ancient civilization and stunning geological formations makes it a place of profound interest and beauty.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can people access travel information?
<ul>
<li>Travel information is accessible through various means, including travel websites, guidebooks, travel agencies, online forums, and mobile apps. People can also seek recommendations from friends and family who have traveled to specific destinations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do people have different personalities in different regions of your country?
<ul>
<li>Yes, people in different regions of my country may exhibit variations in customs, traditions, and even dialects, which can influence their perceived personalities. However, individual personality traits can vary widely regardless of region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What causes the differences between different regions of your country?
<ul>
<li>Differences between regions can be influenced by historical factors, geography, climate, cultural heritage, and social norms. Each region may have its own unique characteristics shaped by these factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it just youngsters who like to try new things, or do people of your parents&rsquo; age also like to try new things?
<ul>
<li>People of all ages can enjoy trying new things and embracing new experiences. Age is not necessarily a barrier to exploring new interests or activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is a great tourist destination also a good place to live?
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily. While a great tourist destination may offer beautiful scenery and attractions, living there can have different considerations such as job opportunities, cost of living, and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do people who go to live in small towns think these towns are more interesting than the big cities?
<ul>
<li>People who choose to live in small towns may appreciate the sense of community, slower pace of life, and natural surroundings that these areas offer. They may find these aspects more appealing than the hustle and bustle of big cities.</li>

<p>Someone I know who recently moved to a new place is my friend Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>Who she is:</strong> Sarah is a close friend of mine, and we have known each other since college. She used to live in the suburbs of a major city.</p>
<p><strong>What the new place is like:</strong> Sarah recently moved to a vibrant and bustling neighborhood in the heart of the city. Her new apartment is in a high-rise building with stunning views of the city skyline. The neighborhood is known for its trendy cafes, restaurants, and cultural attractions.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> &ldquo;Why do some young people keep moving?&rdquo;</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between living alone and living with roommates?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Living alone entails having an entire living space to oneself, with no roommates or shared accommodations. Living with roommates involves sharing a living space with one or more individuals, often to reduce expenses. The key difference is the level of privacy and personal space, as well as the potential for social interactions and shared responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;Is it beneficial for young people to live by themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Living by themselves can be beneficial for young people in terms of gaining independence, learning life skills, and experiencing personal growth.

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Besides cooking, are there any other skills that people need to learn if they live on their own?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Living on one&rsquo;s own may require additional skills such as budgeting, managing household chores, handling bills and finances, and maintaining a sense of security. Problem-solving and time management skills become crucial when living independently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;What kinds of people tend to live by themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>People who tend to live by themselves often include young adults seeking independence, individuals who prioritize privacy, professionals with busy schedules, and those who can afford the costs of independent living. It varies based on personal preferences and circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;How can parents and teachers help young people to live independently?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents and teachers can help young people by teaching life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and time management. Encouraging responsible decision-making, fostering self-reliance, and providing guidance on handling challenges can also prepare them for independent living.</li>

<p>I am particularly interested in learning more about the Renaissance period in European history.</p>
<p><strong>When it happened:</strong> The <strong>Renaissance</strong> period took place roughly between the 14th and 17th centuries, with its origins in Italy and subsequently spreading across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>What I know about it:</strong> I have a basic understanding of the Renaissance as a cultural and intellectual movement that marked a transition from the medieval to the modern era. During this period, there was a resurgence of interest in classical learning, arts, and sciences. Renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo produced masterpieces, and scholars made significant advancements in fields such as literature, astronomy, and mathematics. It was also a time of exploration, with voyages of discovery led by explorers like Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p><strong>Why I would like to learn more:</strong> I find the Renaissance period fascinating due to its profound impact on the course of human history. It was a time of creativity, innovation, and cultural transformation that laid the foundation for many aspects of the modern world, including art, science, literature, and exploration. I would like to delve deeper into this period to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the individuals, ideas, and events that shaped it and to appreciate its enduring influence on contemporary culture.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> &ldquo;Should everyone know history?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, knowing history is valuable as it helps individuals understand the context of the present, learn from past mistakes and achievements, and gain insights into the development of societies and cultures. While not everyone needs to be an expert historian, a basic knowledge of history is essential for informed citizenship and cultural awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;In what ways can children learn history?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Children can learn history through various means, including formal education in schools, reading history books, visiting museums and historical sites, watching documentaries, and engaging in discussions with parents or educators. Hands-on activities, reenactments, and interactive learning experiences can also make history more engaging for children.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;What are the differences between learning history from books and from videos?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning history from books and videos offers different experiences. Books provide in-depth written information, allowing readers to explore details and analyze historical events. Videos, on the other hand, offer visual and auditory elements, making history come to life through images, reenactments, and expert commentary. Both mediums have their merits, and the choice may depend on individual preferences and learning styles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Is it difficult to protect and preserve historic buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserving historic buildings can be challenging due to factors like aging, structural deterioration, environmental conditions, and changing land-use patterns. It often requires significant financial resources and expertise in architectural conservation and restoration. Additionally, striking a balance between preservation and accommodating modern needs can be a complex task.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;Who should be responsible for protecting historic buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The responsibility for protecting historic buildings typically falls on a combination of stakeholders, including governments, local authorities, historical preservation organizations, property owners, and the wider community. Collaboration among these parties is often necessary to ensure the preservation of culturally significant structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;Who should pay for the preservation of historic buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding for the preservation of historic buildings can come from various sources, including government grants, private donations, philanthropic organizations, and heritage tourism revenue. In some cases, property owners may bear some of the costs, but public and private partnerships are often essential to ensure the financial sustainability of preservation efforts.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a rather disappointing experience at a restaurant a few months ago, and I&rsquo;d like to share that with you.</p>
<p>It happened at a restaurant called &ldquo;TasteBites&rdquo; in the downtown area of my city. My friends and I decided to dine there because we had heard good things about their food. However, our experience didn&rsquo;t match our expectations.</p>
<p>First, the service was exceptionally slow. It took nearly 30 minutes for a server to take our orders, and the restaurant wasn&rsquo;t even crowded at that time. After placing our orders, we waited for over an hour for our food to arrive. When it finally did, the dishes were lukewarm at best, and it was clear they had been sitting for a while.</p>
<p>Moreover, the server seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the meal. We had to repeatedly ask for water, and when one of my friends requested a condiment, it was completely forgotten.</p>
<p>We decided to address the issue with the server, explaining our dissatisfaction with the slow service and the quality of the food. The server apologized and said there had been some kitchen delays that evening. To their credit, they offered to replace our lukewarm dishes with fresh ones, and they did so promptly. However, the overall experience had already been marred.</p>
<p>I felt quite disappointed and frustrated by the experience. While mistakes and delays can happen in any restaurant, it was the combination of slow service, inattentive staff, and lukewarm food that made this a particularly unpleasant dining experience. I expected more from a place with a good reputation.</p>
<p>Addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do most people respond to bad services?
<ul>
<li>Most people respond to bad services by expressing their concerns to the staff or management. This can include requesting refunds, replacements, or discounts. Some may also share their experiences on review platforms or social media to inform others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you think services are better now than in the past?
<ul>
<li>Service quality can vary widely across different establishments and regions. In some cases, advancements in technology and increased competition have led to improved services. However, the quality of service can still vary, and some businesses prioritize customer satisfaction more than others.</li>

<p>One happy experience from my childhood that I fondly remember is a family camping trip to a picturesque forest when I was about nine years old.</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> During the camping trip, my family and I set up a tent near a serene, crystal-clear lake surrounded by lush greenery. We spent our days hiking through the forest, swimming in the lake, and enjoying delicious campfire-cooked meals. One evening, we gathered around the campfire to tell stories and roast marshmallows, creating lasting memories.</p>

<p><strong>Why it was a happy experience:</strong> This childhood camping trip was a happy experience for several reasons. Firstly, it allowed me to connect with nature in a profound way. The forest was teeming with wildlife, and the sounds of birds and rustling leaves created a soothing and calming atmosphere. Secondly, spending quality time with family and friends around the campfire fostered a sense of togetherness and created lasting bonds. We laughed, told stories, and shared experiences that I still cherish to this day. Lastly, the sense of adventure and exploration awakened my curiosity and love for the outdoors, which has stayed with me throughout my life.

<blockquote>
<p>I once spent a significant amount of time with my niece, who was about four years old at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Who this child was:</strong> My niece, let&rsquo;s call her Emily, is my sister&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>When you spent time with this child:</strong> This particular occasion happened during a family gathering for a holiday celebration. I had taken some time off work to be with my family.</p>
<p><strong>What you did together:</strong> Emily and I engaged in various activities throughout the day. We played board games, built a blanket fort in the living room, read children&rsquo;s books together, and even did some simple art and crafts. We also had a mini &ldquo;tea party&rdquo; with juice and snacks, complete with stuffed animal guests.</p>
<p><strong>Why you spent time with this child:</strong> I spent time with Emily because I wanted to bond with her and create positive memories. Family gatherings are a great opportunity to strengthen connections, especially with younger family members. I also wanted to give her parents a bit of a break and help entertain her during the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>How you felt about it:</strong> Spending time with Emily was a joyful and heartwarming experience. Her boundless energy, curiosity, and innocence were a refreshing reminder of the simple joys of childhood. I felt a deep sense of love and responsibility in being a positive influence in her life, and it was immensely rewarding to see her laughing, learning, and growing during our time together.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s address your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you think children should have a lot of toys?</strong> The quantity of toys is less important than the quality of playtime. A variety of toys can help stimulate creativity and learning, but it&rsquo;s essential to balance toys with other activities that encourage imagination and social interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Where do children usually play?</strong> Children play in various places, including parks, playgrounds, schools, at home, and with friends. The choice of location often depends on the child&rsquo;s age, interests, and available resources.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think there are too many rules for children to follow, whether at school or home?</strong> Rules are necessary for setting boundaries and teaching children values and discipline. However, it&rsquo;s essential to strike a balance between rules and allowing children to explore and learn from their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think children should follow all the rules?</strong> Children should follow essential rules that ensure their safety, well-being, and the well-being of others. However, parents and educators should also allow room for reasonable autonomy and decision-making to foster independence and responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think it&rsquo;s necessary for parents to make decisions for their children?</strong> Parents should make decisions that are in the best interests of their children, especially when it comes to health, education, and safety. However, as children grow, it&rsquo;s essential to involve them in decision-making to help them develop decision-making skills and independence.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think it is good for parents to help their children choose friends?</strong> Parents can provide guidance and teach their children about making good choices in friendships. However, it&rsquo;s important to strike a balance between guidance and allowing children to develop their social skills and make their own friends. Overly controlling parental involvement in friendships can be counterproductive.</li>

<p>I can certainly describe an occasion when I received incorrect information.</p>
<p><strong>When I got it:</strong> A few years ago, I was planning a trip to a foreign country for a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>How I got it:</strong> I got the incorrect information from an online travel forum. I was researching travel tips and local customs for the destination, and I came across a forum post that claimed a specific visa requirement for the country had changed.</p>
<p><strong>How I found it was incorrect:</strong> After reading the forum post, I decided to double-check the information by visiting the official website of the country&rsquo;s embassy. There, I found that the visa requirement had not changed, and the information on the forum was inaccurate.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s address your additional questions:</p>

<li><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between email and phone in terms of providing information?</strong> Email and phone are both communication tools, but they differ in terms of their format. Email provides a written record and can be asynchronous (not requiring an immediate response), while phone calls offer real-time verbal communication.</li>
<li><strong>Which do you think is the better way to provide information, by phone or by email?</strong> The choice between phone and email depends on the context and the preferences of the individuals involved. Email is often used for documentation and non-urgent communication, while phone calls can be more efficient for immediate or complex discussions.</li>
<li><strong>How do people determine the accuracy of information?</strong> People can determine the accuracy of information by cross-referencing multiple reliable sources, checking for citations and references, assessing the credibility of the author or source, and considering the context in which the information is presented.</li>
<li><strong>How do people make sure they&rsquo;re getting the right information?</strong> To ensure they are getting the right information, people should use critical thinking skills, verify facts from multiple trustworthy sources, and consider the expertise and bias of the sources. Additionally, seeking advice from experts or professionals in the relevant field can help confirm the accuracy of information.</li>

<p><strong>Where I was:</strong> One occasion when I lost my way was when I was visiting a large, unfamiliar city for the first time. I was in the downtown area, exploring the city&rsquo;s attractions.</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> While I was engrossed in exploring the city&rsquo;s landmarks and architecture, I took a few turns down side streets without paying close attention to my surroundings. Soon, I realized that I had lost my sense of direction, and nothing looked familiar. It was disorienting because I couldn&rsquo;t immediately identify any landmarks or street signs.</p>
<p><strong>How I felt:</strong> I felt a mixture of anxiety and frustration. Being lost in an unfamiliar place can be unsettling, especially when you&rsquo;re not sure how to find your way back to a familiar area.

<p>I remember a car journey vividly that happened during the summer of 2018.</p>
<p><strong>When it happened:</strong> It was in the middle of July 2018 when this memorable car journey took place.</p>
<p><strong>Where you went:</strong> My friends and I decided to embark on a road trip from our hometown to the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia, USA. We had heard about the stunning scenery and hiking trails there, so it was an adventure we eagerly anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>What you did:</strong> During the journey, we explored the scenic byways of the Blue Ridge Parkway, which offered breathtaking views of the mountains and valleys below. We hiked along various trails, picnicked by serene streams, and visited overlooks that provided panoramic vistas. The evenings were spent around a campfire, sharing stories and enjoying the tranquility of the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Who you had the car journey with:</strong> I had the pleasure of sharing this car journey with three of my closest friends. We all shared a love for nature and adventure, which made the trip even more enjoyable. We took turns driving and navigating, ensuring a smooth and collaborative journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why you remember it well:</strong> This car journey is etched in my memory for several reasons. Firstly, the stunning natural beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains left a profound impact on me. The clear mountain air, lush forests, and scenic overlooks were unlike anything I had experienced before. Secondly, the trip strengthened the bonds of friendship with my companions. We shared not only the excitement of the adventure but also the responsibilities and challenges of traveling together. Lastly, it was a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Being in the midst of nature&rsquo;s grandeur allowed for introspection and a deep appreciation for the world&rsquo;s natural wonders.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What benefits does public transport bring to the world?</strong> Public transport provides numerous benefits, including reduced traffic congestion, lower carbon emissions, cost savings, increased mobility for people without cars, and decreased dependence on personal vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Is it too late for people to get their driver&rsquo;s license at the age of 18?</strong> No, it&rsquo;s not too late for individuals to obtain their driver&rsquo;s license at the age of 18. In many countries, this is the legal age for obtaining a driver&rsquo;s license, and it&rsquo;s a common age for young adults to start learning to drive.</li>
<li><strong>What qualities does a driver need to have?</strong> A good driver should have qualities like attentiveness, patience, good judgment, adaptability to various road conditions, responsibility, and the ability to remain calm under pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think the government should make it a rule for people to use public transport?</strong> Mandating the use of public transport for everyone may not be practical or feasible in all situations. However, governments can encourage the use of public transport through incentives, improved infrastructure, and public awareness campaigns to reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Which jobs require people to be good at driving?</strong> Jobs that require good driving skills include delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi or rideshare drivers, bus drivers, and courier drivers, among others.</li>
<li><strong>Do you see driverless cars as the future of cars?</strong> Driverless cars have the potential to play a significant role in the future of transportation, offering benefits such as improved safety and reduced traffic congestion.

<p>Certainly, I can describe an activity that made me feel tired:</p>
<p>It happened a few months ago during a hiking trip in a national park. My friends and I had decided to take a weekend getaway to enjoy nature and explore some beautiful trails.</p>
<p>The reason I took part in this activity was to unwind from the stresses of daily life and to reconnect with nature. I had been feeling overwhelmed with work and needed a break to rejuvenate.</p>
<p>The activity was a long day hike through rugged terrain. We started early in the morning and embarked on a challenging trail that led us through dense forests, steep ascents, and rocky terrain. It was a full-day adventure, and we covered a significant distance.</p>
<p>The hike made me feel tired primarily because of the physical exertion involved. The steep inclines and uneven terrain required a lot of effort to navigate. Carrying a backpack with supplies added to the physical strain. Additionally, we encountered unexpected weather changes, which made the hike even more demanding.</p>
<p>Despite the exhaustion, the experience was incredibly rewarding. The sense of accomplishment and the breathtaking views we encountered along the way made it all worth it. It was a great way to disconnect from technology and immerse myself in the natural world.</p>

<ul>
<li>It varies by country and individual circumstances, but in some cases, people may have fewer holidays due to the demands of modern work schedules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the differences between feeling tired after studying and after exercising?
<ul>
<li>Feeling tired after studying is often mental fatigue, whereas tiredness after exercising is physical fatigue. Both can be accompanied by a sense of accomplishment, but the sensations and recovery methods differ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can people solve the problem of old people easily getting tired?
<ul>
<li>To address fatigue in older individuals, it&rsquo;s important to promote a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, and sufficient rest. Consulting with healthcare professionals for personalized advice is also beneficial.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently watched a movie called &ldquo;The Lost Expedition&rdquo; just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Why I didn&rsquo;t like it:</strong> Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the movie. It had <strong>received a lot of hype and positive reviews</strong>, so I was excited to watch it. However, I found the plot to be convoluted and lacking in coherence. The <strong>character development</strong> was weak, and I <strong>struggled to</strong> connect with the protagonists. Additionally, the pacing of the movie felt uneven, with long stretches of slow-moving scenes followed by sudden, rushed action sequences. This made it challenging to stay engaged with the story.</p>
<p><strong>Why I decided to watch it:</strong> I decided to watch &ldquo;The Lost Expedition&rdquo; because it was marketed as a thrilling adventure film set in a remote jungle, which is a genre I typically enjoy. Moreover, it featured a talented cast, including some of my favorite actors, which further piqued my interest. The trailer and promotional materials also promised a captivating and mysterious storyline.</p>
<p><strong>Why I felt disappointed about it:</strong> I felt disappointed about the movie primarily because it didn&rsquo;t <strong>live up to my expectations</strong>. Given the positive reviews and the intriguing premise, I had anticipated an exciting and well-crafted adventure film. However, the movie&rsquo;s weak plot, lack of character depth, and uneven pacing left me feeling underwhelmed. It was particularly frustrating because I had high hopes for the film based on the initial buzz and marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> &ldquo;Do you believe movie reviews?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider movie reviews to be valuable sources of information when deciding which films to watch. However, I also believe that personal preferences play a significant role, and what one person enjoys, another may not. Therefore, I use movie reviews as a guideline but ultimately trust my own judgment when selecting movies to watch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;What are the different types of films in your country?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>In my country, there is a wide variety of film genres, including action, comedy, drama, romance, science fiction, horror, and documentary films. Additionally, regional cinema and independent films are gaining popularity, offering diverse storytelling and cultural perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;Are historical films popular in your country? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, historical films are quite popular in my country. They often provide a glimpse into our rich cultural heritage and history. People are interested in learning about past events, historical figures, and significant moments through the medium of film. These movies also have the potential to educate and inspire audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Do you think films with famous actors or actresses are more likely to become successful films?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>While famous actors and actresses can draw audiences to theaters, the success of a film ultimately depends on various factors, including its storyline, direction, and overall quality. A well-crafted film with a compelling narrative can succeed even without A-list actors, and vice versa. Star power can be a factor, but it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a film&rsquo;s success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;Why are Japanese animated films so popular?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese animated films, often referred to as anime, are popular worldwide due to their unique storytelling, stunning visuals, and diverse range of genres. Anime explores themes that appeal to audiences of all ages, from fantasy and science fiction to romance and drama. The artistry and creativity in Japanese animation also contribute to its global appeal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;Should the director pay a lot of money to famous actors?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The decision to pay a lot of money to famous actors depends on various factors, including the project&rsquo;s budget, the actor&rsquo;s contribution to the film, and their marketability. While star power can attract audiences, it&rsquo;s essential for directors and producers to balance the budget to ensure the overall quality of the film. Ultimately, the financial arrangements between directors and actors are negotiated based on industry standards and the unique circumstances of each project.</li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the good advertisements I&rsquo;ve come across and find useful is a television commercial that I saw during a prime-time show.</p>
<p>This advertisement was for a water-saving device designed to be installed in household faucets. The ad depicted a typical family in their daily routine, showing them using water for various purposes like washing dishes, brushing teeth, and watering plants. However, what made this commercial stand out was its emphasis on the importance of water conservation.</p>
<p>It showed how the water-saving device easily attaches to faucets and reduces water flow while maintaining adequate pressure. The ad compared the water usage before and after installing the device, highlighting significant savings in both water and money over time. It also conveyed a strong message about environmental responsibility, portraying the family as conscious of their impact on the planet.</p>
<p>I find this advertisement useful for several reasons. Firstly, it raises awareness about a critical issue – water conservation – in a clear and compelling way. It educates viewers about a simple and practical solution that they can implement in their homes to contribute to water preservation efforts. Secondly, it provides a practical and cost-effective solution that can benefit households by reducing water bills while also benefiting the environment.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel positively about this advertisement because it addresses an important global issue and offers a concrete solution that individuals can adopt. It motivates people to take action in a way that is both practical and environmentally responsible.</p>
<p>Now, addressing your additional questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you think of online advertising?
<ul>
<li>Online advertising is a common and effective way for businesses to reach their target audience. It can be informative and engaging when done well, but excessive or intrusive online ads can be annoying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there any great online advertisements?
<ul>
<li>Yes, there are many great online advertisements that have gone viral and garnered widespread attention. These ads often combine creativity, humor, or a compelling message to engage viewers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do people usually buy?
<ul>
<li>People buy a wide range of products and services based on their needs, preferences, and lifestyles. Common purchases include food, clothing, electronics, housing, transportation, and entertainment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why does buying new things make people happy?
<ul>
<li>Buying new things can make people happy because it often satisfies their desires, provides a sense of achievement, and can enhance their quality of life. However, the happiness from material possessions is typically temporary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do people watch useless advertisements in this day and age?
<ul>
<li>People generally try to avoid watching advertisements that they find irrelevant or uninteresting. Advertisers strive to create compelling and relevant content to capture viewers&rsquo; attention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you think there is too much advertising in our daily lives?
<ul>
<li>The level of advertising in daily life varies by location and media consumption. Some people may feel that there is an excessive amount of advertising, while others may not be bothered by it. Balancing the need for advertising with respecting consumers&rsquo; preferences is an ongoing challenge for marketers and regulators.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>One game I thoroughly enjoyed playing when I was younger was &ldquo;Hide and Seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What the game was:</strong> Hide and Seek is a classic children&rsquo;s game where one person closes their eyes and counts to a predetermined number while the other participants hide. After counting, the seeker attempts to find the hidden players. When the seeker spots someone, they shout &ldquo;Ready or not, here I come!&rdquo; and the hidden player is found.</p>
<p><strong>Where I played it:</strong> We played Hide and Seek primarily in our neighborhood, which was filled with houses and yards, providing plenty of hiding spots. We also played it in local parks and during family gatherings at our grandparents&rsquo; house.</p>
<p><strong>Who I played it with:</strong> I played Hide and Seek with my neighborhood friends, schoolmates, and family members. It was a versatile game that could be enjoyed with both small and large groups of people.</p>
<p><strong>Why I enjoyed playing the game:</strong> I enjoyed Hide and Seek for several reasons. Firstly, it was a game that required creativity and strategy. Finding the perfect hiding spot involved thinking outside the box, and as a child, it was a fun challenge. Secondly, the game encouraged physical activity and outdoor play, which was both enjoyable and healthy. Running, hiding, and seeking added an element of excitement and adventure to our playtime. Lastly, Hide and Seek fostered strong social bonds and friendships. It provided an opportunity for us to bond, laugh, and share in the joy of discovery when someone was found. The game was a source of simple, innocent fun that brought our community of friends and family closer together.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> &ldquo;Do boys and girls play different games?&rdquo;</p>

<li>While there can be some gender-related differences in game preferences, it&rsquo;s important to note that boys and girls can enjoy a wide variety of games. Many traditional gender stereotypes related to game preferences are becoming less relevant as children have more diverse interests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> &ldquo;Are outdoor sports important for kids?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, outdoor sports are important for kids&rsquo; physical and social development. They promote physical fitness, teamwork, coordination, and social interaction. Outdoor activities also encourage a healthy lifestyle and provide an opportunity for kids to connect with nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> &ldquo;Why do people play different games now than before?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The availability of new technologies and changing societal trends have influenced the types of games people play. Digital games and technology have introduced a wide range of options, and people&rsquo;s interests and preferences have evolved over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> &ldquo;Is winning important in games?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>While winning can add a competitive element to games, it&rsquo;s not always the primary focus. Many games are enjoyed for the fun, camaraderie, and learning experiences they offer. The importance of winning varies depending on the game and individual preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> &ldquo;Which is better, individual games or team-based games?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The preference for individual or team-based games is subjective and varies from person to person. Both types of games have their merits. Individual games may promote self-reliance and personal achievement, while team-based games emphasize collaboration, communication, and shared success. The choice often depends on personal interests and the desired experience.</li>

<p>One of the most beautiful cities I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of visiting is Prague, which is located in the Czech Republic. I first learned about Prague through travel documentaries and books, which showcased its rich history and architectural beauty.</p>
<p>Prague is renowned for its stunning architecture, including the Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and the Astronomical Clock. The cityscape is characterized by a blend of Gothic, Baroque, Romanesque, and Renaissance styles, giving it a unique and enchanting appearance.</p>
<p>What makes Prague truly famous is its historical significance and well-preserved medieval Old Town.

The city is also famous for its charming cobblestone streets, vibrant cultural scene, and delicious Czech cuisine.</p>
<p>Prague&rsquo;s beauty lies in its ability to transport you back in time. Walking through its ancient streets feels like stepping into a fairy tale. The architecture is awe-inspiring, the winding streets are full of hidden gems, and the Vltava River running through the city adds to its picturesque quality.

<p>The painting portrays a <strong>breathtaking sunset scene</strong> by the sea. The artist has <strong>captured</strong> the play of warm, golden hues as the sun sets over the tranquil water. There&rsquo;s a sense of serenity and peace in the painting, with the reflection of the sun on the water&rsquo;s surface creating a beautiful, shimmering effect. The sky is painted with various shades of orange, pink, and purple, creating a vivid and ethereal atmosphere. In the foreground, there&rsquo;s a silhouette of a lone sailboat, further enhancing the sense of solitude and serenity.</p>
<p>The painting was created by a local artist named Emily Johnson. She is known for her ability to capture the beauty of nature in her artwork. &ldquo;Serenity at Sunset&rdquo; is one of her most celebrated pieces, and it has garnered attention and admiration from art enthusiasts.</p>
<p>I like this painting for several reasons. Firstly, the artist&rsquo;s skill in capturing the play of light and color is exceptional. It&rsquo;s almost as if you can feel the warmth of the setting sun and hear the gentle lapping of the water. Secondly, the painting evokes a sense of tranquility and calm, making it a perfect piece to gaze at when you need to unwind. Lastly, it reminds me of the beauty of nature and the importance of taking moments to appreciate the world around us.</p>

<p>One of the books I have read many times is &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; by Harper Lee.</p>
<p><strong>What the book is about:</strong> &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; is a classic novel set in the American South during the 1930s. It tells the story of Scout Finch, a young girl, and her brother Jem, as they grow up in a racially divided town. The book explores themes of racism, injustice, morality, and the loss of innocence, primarily through the lens of the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman.</p>
<p><strong>How often I have read this book:</strong> I have read &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; multiple times over the years, at least four or five times.</p>
<p><strong>Why I read it:</strong> I return to this book because of its powerful storytelling, compelling characters, and the depth of its themes. It offers a timeless exploration of societal issues that are sadly still relevant today, and each re-reading provides a fresh perspective and new insights.</p>
<p><strong>Effect the book has had on me:</strong> &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; has had a profound impact on me. It has made me more aware of issues related to justice, equality, and empathy. The character of Atticus Finch, the children&rsquo;s father, serves as a moral compass, and his unwavering commitment to doing what is right has inspired me to be a more principled and compassionate person. The book has reinforced the importance of standing up against injustice and prejudice, even in the face of adversity.</p>

Some people prefer the convenience of e-books, while others enjoy the tactile experience of printed books. Both formats have their merits.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think people need to develop the habit of reading? Why?</strong> Yes, developing the habit of reading is important because it fosters critical thinking, improves vocabulary, enhances empathy, and broadens one&rsquo;s knowledge. Reading is a lifelong skill that can bring both enjoyment and personal growth.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think reading books can make people happier?</strong> Reading can bring happiness by providing an escape, fostering a sense of connection with characters and stories, and offering insights into life&rsquo;s complexities. It can be a source of joy and solace for many.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think e-books will make people read more? Why?</strong> E-books have made reading more accessible and convenient for many people, but whether they make people read more depends on individual preferences.
