The park covers a vast area, with lush green lawns, colorful flowerbeds, and towering trees that provide ample shade. I often go to Green Oasis Park with my friends or family. It’s a great place for a leisurely stroll, a picnic, or even some outdoor sports. Sometimes, I visit it alone to find some solitude and read a book under a tree. What makes Green Oasis Park truly special is its serene atmosphere. The moment you step inside, you’re greeted by the soothing sounds of birds chirping, and you can feel the stress of the day melt away. There are well-maintained walking paths that wind through the park, and benches strategically placed for people to sit and enjoy the surroundings. The park also has a beautiful lake with ducks and swans, which adds to its charm. The park is impeccably maintained by the local authorities, ensuring that it’s always clean and welcoming. There’s also a small café where you can grab a coffee or a snack if you’re in the mood. I love to visit Green Oasis Park because it provides a peaceful and natural escape from the urban chaos. It’s a place where I can connect with nature, breathe in fresh air, and recharge my batteries.

It’s like a green sanctuary in the middle of the city, and that’s why I enjoy visiting it so much.

The park also has a beautiful lake with ducks and swans, which adds to its charm. The park is impeccably maintained by the local authorities, ensuring that it’s always clean and welcoming. There’s also a small café where you can grab a coffee or a snack if you’re in the mood. I love to visit Green Oasis Park because it provides a peaceful and natural escape from the urban chaos. It’s a place where I can connect with nature, breathe in fresh air, and recharge my batteries. Whether I’m having a leisurely conversation with friends, playing frisbee, or simply meditating by the lake, this park offers a sense of tranquility and connection to the environment that I find incredibly refreshing. It’s like a green sanctuary in the middle of the city, and that’s why I enjoy visiting it so much. So, that’s Green Oasis Park in my city – a delightful place where I can relax, bond with loved ones, and find solace in nature’s embrace. It’s a true gem in our urban landscape.

英语基础：本人英语基础比较一般，高考新一卷135，大英四3.3，四级603，六级549，在备考之前对GRE几乎没有什么基础 单词：用的是kmf上的3000和1400以及zw的等价词和填空1600题生词伴侣（这个是把填空1600题的所有感觉有难度的词筛出来的表格）每天都花五六个小时记单词，大概是APP背累了再背PDF再背纸质书这样最后1400和等价词大概背了五遍，3000背了三遍，1600过了一遍的样子。最后考试的时候感觉大部分填空的单词都认识，做的也相对顺利。 填空：填空发现机经的时候比较晚了，离考试还有十天左右。最开始用的是陈琦基础24套，那个比较简单，全做完了，并且上面单词跟3000基本重合的。zw1600开始用PDF刷题后来发现kmf网站更好用，大概做完了所有的medium，一半的easy，和一点点的hard，感觉考试的时候遇到了四五道原题 阅读：早早发现自己根本读不懂，于是阅读几乎没准备，把拿分重心放到填空上了。加起来做了差不多十篇吧，打算考试的时候战略性放弃长阅读。最后考试的时候的确读不完，短阅读认真做长阅读直接瞎猜的。 数学：备考初期，各个部分的题都做了差不多十个试试难度，后面发现填空做不完了再没管过，考试前一晚上临睡觉翻完了数学词汇。考试的时候感觉题目对中国学生来说真的小意思，不过要认真一点，做完之后好好检查，尽量别提前太早交。另外，记住那些常用的重要的词汇，比如直径半径分子分母等等。 作文：这个不做错误示范了，我两篇都写了刚400字，除了打字慢，还有根本想不出来该用什么论据。好像字数要到550才能拿到一个好看的分数？因为作文我已经准备二战了 模考：考前务必要熟悉流程，我在雷哥上做了一套，但没做几个题，但对于怎么看前面的检查和用计算器相对很熟悉了，很有必要！ 希望各位杀G的小伙伴都取得理想成绩呀！ 我的GRE学习经历大概可以分为两段：第一段是2022年在某杭州机构学的，其中写作上了两节课，数学上了一节课，阅读写作上了若干节课（这个阶段基本就是混，比如阅读抄答案，填空查字典），但到今年为止基本已经忘光。8月开始在培训托福的机构上GRE课，上了两节阅读两节写作，背了400个单词就上考场了。因为有科研任务，备考时间大约两周，每天2-4h。来分享一些经验。 阅读： GRE阅读比写作容易备考很多。因为阅读并没有那么多生僻单词。个人觉得阅读首先要通读全文，然后再做题，不能像雅思托福一样看题找答案。遇到不懂的单词先猜，猜不出来可以尝试直接去掉这个词再读全文。如果之前有过托福基础，做GRE阅读会更容易一些。选择题切记别想多，按最直接的选。并且一定要把选项全部看完。逻辑题也是如此，一定要搞清楚原文到底说的是啥，然后把选项依次带入验证。 数学： 基本裸考。数学的难度介于小学和初中数学之间，极少数涉及高中以上内容（比如正态分布）。因此做题主要就是仔细，考虑全面。可以看一些机构整理的专有名词表，防止看到单词不知道什么意思而丢分，例如我这次不知道range有极差的意思，看见题脑子空白了一段时间。 写作： 理工科对写作要求不太高，而且新GRE已经取消了argument只剩issue了。issue比较难写，是因为选题通常比较抽象，比如一些政治和哲学论点。我机构老师采取的策略是写大纲，个人感觉很有用。issue和托福写作还不一样，托福是可以用自己或者朋友的例子的，而GRE不行，需要列举一些“高级”的例子，或者直接理论论证。例子可以多积累一点，配合写大纲。 填空 重点来了。填空是GRE最恶心的部分，理论上需要背大量（在GRE考试之外再也见不到的）单词。但填空也有蒙题技巧。首先，一些填空题的正确选项可能是比较简单的单词，这时候可以直接选你觉得对的；或者所有你认识的单词都觉得不对，那剩下的那（两）个不认识的单词就大概率是正确选项。如果上述两个策略都失效了，还有一种冒险性比较大的策略：众所周知一些英文词根词缀具有感情色彩。比如un-(e.g. unlikely)，a-(e.g. abandon)具有否定、负面的感情色彩。另一些则有肯定、正面的感情色彩。这时候可以根据词的感情色彩来匹配句子的感情色彩。另外，背单词从高频的开始背（一些机构会整理高频词，网上也有高频词），统计学不会骗人的。另外运气也很重要

资本主义存续的逻辑自工业革命以降，以雇佣劳动为基础的资本主义生产方式通过技术革新和市场扩张，推动了生产力的跃迁式进步，然而，生产社会化与生产资料私有制之间的固有矛盾使得以剥削为本质的资本主义阶级社会不断震荡于贫富分化、生产过剩的复合危机。不同于封建社会，在其本身无法容纳的新经济基础还未出现前，经历了从自由到国家垄断阶段的资本主义统治机器为了消弭资产阶级和无产阶级的内在矛盾，建构了一系列旨在分化无产阶级的横向叙事与实现隐性奴役的精巧符号机制1，本文试图揭露当代资本主义以放大人民内部矛盾方式维护其合法性和稳定性的原因和具体手段，以批判其压迫本质。 作为一种基于商品生产和货币交换的异化社会形态，资本主义的寄生于被广泛标的的一切价值客体之中。人既以劳动力形式被出卖，又沦为再生产环节的消费奴隶，从而矮化为资本增殖的直接手段，即便是掌握生产资料的资产阶级，也不过是资本的人格化主体。2于是，资本主义结构性地运作于私有制基础上的两大基本阶级与社会再生产在形式与内容上的耦合过程，实现资本增殖和调和阶级矛盾便成为其存续的现实张力，前者是目的，后者则是手段的总和。

合法性建构实现自身增殖是资本的天然使命。2社会化生产下，资产阶级通过生产资料资本化后的周期性运作，不仅需要通过剥削无产阶级以获得剩余价值，也要求大量的无产阶级作为消费者参与到被资本广泛度量的商品的价值实现过程中去，因此资本主义制度不仅派生了受压迫的潜在掘墓人，也源源不断地筛取了劳动力这一社会再生产中无可替代的燃料，从而最大限度的榨取了剩余价值，奠基了资本主义的规模与效率导向。 为了合理化资本主义的剥削机制、维护统治，资产阶级在深层逻辑上建构起一套以自洽的叙事，即在物质层面以商品经济和消费社会为载体的行为准则限定被统治阶级的作用范畴，同时在思想上编织一套以分化无产阶级为手段的叙事话语。以消费为标志的符号社会1为叙事的完备性提供了客观基础，而性别、地域矛盾的转嫁又更好地标签化这些消费的主体，进一步加深了资本主义再生产的坚实基础。

符号崇拜基于工业化、市场化的资本主义现代化路径，资本将物质度量为可供交易的消费品，而商品符号1在资本规则的集体叙事下约束了使用者的行为，将无产阶级也置于一套无法脱离的生产生活体系之中，人性的自然需求被嫁接于社会性的消费浪潮之内，而交易本身隐去了资本主义的结构本质，物质的欲望反而成为了他们辩护资本主义生产方式的内驱动力，由此，阶级的对立被掩盖，表象的价值均衡与实在的利益剥削在后者的集体意识形态中得以错置。 资本主义的生产模式决定了商品化社会下，人作为劳动力被卷入庞大的生产结构之中沦为消耗品，同时，资本在社会化生产的循环链路中不断通过对劳动者的剥削和商品价值增殖的过程来构建起利益的势垒。在消费社会中，需求侧铺展为更为精细的标签画像，性别、地域乃至年龄、偏好都服务于消费本身，个体的反抗在博取他人认同和辨识的消费中转化为心理层面的满足感，我们消费的并不再是物的单一使用价值，而是通过消费体现社会地位与身份的认同，从而无形地消解了资本主义体制下社会再生产中统治阶级的褫夺原罪，而参与其中的无产阶级在集体无意识中为资本主义生产―利润体系的高效运转和规模扩大贡献了正向力量，因此消费作为符号意义体系结构，是现代资本主义社会合法性的根据。 另一方面，消费主义又利用了性别等领域的对立。性别化消费将商品赋予性别气质，建立身份标签和消费的主观联系，将消费行为注入了性别化符号的价值，实现了资本更为隐性的增殖。

身份政治神话当代资本主义话语体系下大肆宣扬的地域、性别等横向矛盾构建了一套温和的“种族隔离”机制，通过强化刻板印象和生理性差异，诱导群众相互攻讦、以个体的极化抹煞作为同为被资本主义制度系统性压迫的集体的团结可能性。 不仅资产阶级在议题上制造割裂，资本主义生产体系本身也在提供分化的社会基础，企业中普遍存在的职业性别歧视和工资差异刻意放大了群体间的差异，而以西方发达资本主义国家代表性的以“宠坏”弱势、边缘群体的身份政治手段，则进一步迫使本就可怜的底层个体不得不趋附于多元文化主义叙事下的资本主义政治制度，成为意识自觉的现有体制维护者。4 性别议题原本是平权主义的分支，对女性权益的维护应当是消除传统桎梏尚未完全解体的性别歧视与刻板印象。然而，在资产阶级蛊惑下，性别标签所争论的群体特质，却恰恰潜移默化地成为扩大隔阂的帮凶。值得一提的是，从生物学上说，男女之间的基因演化最终是趋同的，男性与女性不同基因对其认知与行为模式差异的影响远远小于外在环境等因素。但资本主义性别叙事下的女权主义中将反抗精神塑造为一种“弱势者的群体皈依”，巧妙地忽视了话语权的分野并非存在于性别，使女本位和资本主义本身深度耦合，以性别压迫反抗逃避了阶级斗争，强化了压迫本身的土壤。事实上，当代妇女解放与女性意识的觉醒原本就是在后工业化时代，社会生产关系中的性别差异被机器的运用所逐渐抹平、女性大规模参与到现代生产活动之中的成果，如今身处在父权制与消费符号主义双重夹击的女性，在这样的引导下，攻讦男性却成为了她们唯一的出路。 身份政治表面上看似极具反抗力量，实际成为了与资本主义相当匹配的意识形态框架，即拥有实质地位的资产阶级可以通过舆论、选举、集体叙事的三位一体将阶级意识转变为政治权力交接中的横向议题，而掌握议题主动权的资产阶级则永远处于政治权力的舞台之上。5

思考题 1 选题 制度创新与中国式现代化。 从卸下旧社会三座大山到迈向现代化强国建设新征程，中国在站起来、富起来、强起来的历史脉络中找到了一条自主适定、以制度创新一以贯之的独特现代化道路，以思想理念引领，并从其战略与战术中分别派生完备架构与动态规制的实践，宣告了历史终结论和西方单线路径依赖史观的破产。 战略上知行交互。始终以理论指引实践，实事求是，统筹人文地理、阶层产业等规模和结构的特有国情，在社会主义原则下顺应先进生产力方向，通过顶层设计明晰目标，把握民族复兴国家富强的总体方向，规范了现代化的中心任务、原则和本质要求。此外，以实践导向反馈理论创新，在改革试验和制度化积累的循环中，逐渐建构起从粗放到集约、创新协调绿色开放共享的现代化发展模式，服务于最广大人民根本利益，在各个阶段锚定顺应现实规律的着力点。 战术上要素协同。完善各领域联系，将现代化贯穿于五位一体布局之中，让生产方式的广义主体相适配，注重有效市场和有为政府、城市群拓与乡村振兴、执政党和政府、公有经济与私有资本等要素的权衡和配合，在执政党总揽全局、协调各方的宏观尺度下，以政府报告、五年规划等常态规划推动策略创新，如在节奏快、容错强的领域引入社会资本，合理使用金融工具在适度的贫富差距下分配各主体在生产中的地位，以共同富裕和国际竞争旨归推动结构性改革，拉动制造产业等供给端升级，带动需求端的扩张，统筹国内循环和同国际双循环的协同发展。 空间上，架构完备是根本。中国式现代化有效发挥一切积极因素，实践探索和制度化相得益彰，打通了规划、执行、监督的链路。既覆盖农业工业服务业三大产业和政府企业两大主体，统筹地区、城乡、收入差异，又践行全过程人民民主和协商民主，团结各阶层有序参与建设，使生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑的基本矛盾在战略战术的迭代中更加系统完备。同上述规划环节的科学民主性对偶，地区试点和举国体制的交织、央地人事财各类权力的分工，则构成了中国式现代化高效执行力和创新力的根基。 时间上，规策动态是保障。从韬光养晦到奋发有为、双轨制到市场决定资源配置、从自立自主到融入国际，从以农哺工到乡村振兴，在大时代的振荡中，中国式现代化下的内政外交、政治经济方方面面都围绕着主要矛盾和国际情势，抓住机遇，保持历史主动，因势而动、顺势而为，不断推进方针与制度的革新，打破路径依赖，换道超车，审视未来。 总之，中国式现代化是社会主义性质、具有中国特色的现代化，摒弃了西方物质与资本导向、两极分化、对外扩张的老路，科学而富有活力。 （984字）

从劳动分工和异化劳动等视角，探究“大国大城”论与“美丽乡村”论之间的辩证统一关系。 “大国大城”论与“美丽乡村”论映射出了社会经济发展之于二元的城市和乡村取向模式的路径差异。前者渴望通过规模扩张与分工细化获得更优效率收益，后者考量劳动异化和剩余价值，指出乡村百业兴旺模式以效率代价兼顾劳动者的公平。 发展大城市和乡村振兴在形式上存在对立。城市化意味着生产资料的集中化，人才积聚、资本汇集建构起庞大规模且高度分工协作的产业网络。然而，在市场决定资源配置和私有制资本普遍存在的当代，社会生产过程是产生使用价值的劳动过程和派生剩余价值的价值增殖过程的统一，劳动创造价值，但剩余价值往往被占据支配地位者褫夺。高度社会分工下，规模且系统的工作被分解为简单的流程，个体沦为重复工作的机器，而生产的社会化和所有制的私有进一步割裂了劳动者与它的劳动成果，后者被货币化统一衡量、以商品形式在市场上高速流通，个体的价值被矮化为一套单一维度标准体系下的投入与产出过程，劳动者变为可被交易的生产要素。分工严重阻碍了人的自由全面发展，作为集体的城市得到了更高的收益，但作为个体的劳动者却缺省了应有的公平。 作为多体系统的乡村是我国粮食安全和国民经济发展的压舱石。以农业为基础的乡村百业虽然参与同城市的商品流通和社会化生产，但因其自然条件和所有制结构表征出相对独立的样态。相对分散的土地、资本和人口使农民大多自有生产要素和居住空间，从农林牧副渔五业并举到旅游等新兴产业的蓬勃交融并不改变乡村分散生产模式和农民为自己打工的生产关系，但这种颇具自给自足小农经济色彩的低分工模式也不可避免的牺牲了一定的效率。 两种路径的执理内核在于对于社会发展中效率与公平、短期与长期效益的分歧。现代化建设应当统筹兼顾做大蛋糕和分好蛋糕，国家经济社会的发展也离不开时间尺度下的利弊权衡。 发展大城市和乡村振兴在现代化进程中又是统一的。城乡区别本质上是经济基础即生产力和生产关系上的差异，表现为形式上的二元和载体的内生一致性。形式上，城乡具有相对独立的产业经济体系，然而同时，它们又是置于全国经济格局下相互联系的地域主体。 城乡融合是乡村振兴和城市化的耦合。通过城乡要素自由流动，引导三类产业深度融合，带动乡村产业振兴，规模工业和资本密集型的高新产业则为城市赋以更佳的效能，辅以城乡居民基本权益与服务均等化，乡村为产业资本集中的城市工业提供产能和劳动力过剩危机的“软着陆”蓄水池，城市则为乡村提供更强的三产流动性和工业品，从而实现城市的短期效率与乡村的长期公平的优势互补、共同繁荣。 （996字）

资本无序扩张的三十年这是资本无序扩张的第三十年，与泡沫般飞涨的资本主义繁荣神话相伴的是，工业化和市场化浪潮下生产资料的结构性错配在其让渡于资本权力的进程中精妙地编织起一套无处挣脱的生产方式和叙事体系，即便是矗立于社会金字塔尖的名义精英也潜意识地驯服于资本-消费符号构成的全景社会之内、安适于新贵族般的森严而坚实的壁龛之中。 资本主义首要刻画的是附着于人性原始欲望的商品世界童话。在纸醉金迷的浪潮中，头脑聪明、精于算计的“精致利己主义”轻而易举地渗透了道德意识形态的高地，以财富导向的社会天梯的攀附者们，自发地戴上了旧时代残存的冠冕，在阶级的金字塔沿互相倾轧。在这个效率第一的时代，几乎没有人意识到自己身处于资本疯狂自我增殖的子宫之中，由其浇筑的雇佣制社会化再生产链路和附着于其间的劳动者和资本家，无非是燃料和傀儡的区别，所有人生来的目的便是幻想在资本浇筑的符号幻觉里叱咤风云，他们无一例外地在攫取财富和消费需求的周期里麻木地寻求物欲的安慰，劳作成了自我意识存续的手段本身。 而在商品和消费为通用语言的符号社会里，无产阶级以打工人的身份被赋予了更广泛、更系统性的剥削定位，工人不仅仅作为生产环节的劳动资料被以工资的形式贴上价格标签自由出卖，同时也在货币符号的诱惑下成为劳动产物的需求端被更为精细地剖分为消费主义的二次收割对象。被褫夺了时间和生活的工薪阶层在博取他人认同和辨识的消费行为中无形地将反抗意识转换为心理层面异化了的满足感，财富和消费定义了新的身份价值标签，于是人们并不再孤立地居于物的使用价值作用范畴之中，而是以消费重新勾勒了社会地位与身份认同，在这里，剥削的原罪被巧妙地消弭，无产阶级在集体无意识中反而为资本主义生产―利润体系的高效运转和规模扩大贡献了正向反馈，成为其合法性的建筑师和辩经者。 随着资本扩张悄然僭越了将它释放出来的设计师们所划定的效率范畴，文化意识形态和政治结构便在这套全球化的资本主义生产体系下显得势单力薄，在私有财产神圣不可侵犯的神话里，富人与穷人间事实上如猿猴与人类般地经历了二次自然选择，塑造了从生活方式到价值观的社会隔离，于是从小镇成长起来的新兴精英阶层渐渐失去了和底层共情的意愿，剥削不再是可耻的，福报和奋斗的措辞从老大哥修正主义批判的辞典里焕发新生，一面是劳动消费负债三重枷锁嵌入焦虑和麻木的普遍神色，群众推动历史的史观则被英雄和个体的抽象叙事缓缓取代，另一面是资本的提线木偶将贪婪的目光投射于涵盖了政治权力和舆论场的一切尚未触及的领域，不遗余力地把社会斗争形式分解为多元且离散的要素，被身份标签细化瓦解的无产者则只能不平等地收获可怜的施舍。一批高级打工人陷入归化小资产阶级的自我实现预言之中，另一批人则陷入理论荒芜的桎梏，或是在新自由主义的幻想中极化，或是在宏大叙事中将泛左翼与民族主义联姻。 然而固有的阶级分化和生产力的解放也在反噬着资本储备的统治艺术，于是，资本主义的大厦之巅积聚起几朵不起眼的乌云——阶级分化愈发明显，贫富差距深渊般无法逾越；原本做大蛋糕和技术进步所革新的社会面貌愈发迟滞，衰退下行的危机不再遥远，透支未来则成了唯一的出路。均质化的资本伴随着社会逐渐失去迭代的活力，并向上层建筑深度渗透，即便是婚姻和家庭也悄然开始冠以资本价值的度量，新的媒介也从技术本位的工具趋向沦为资本的喉舌，而后者正试图复刻互联网从开源精神指导的通信载体到充斥着被资本打包成商品而肆意操纵的用户囚笼的规训路径，从而使高度信息化的社会在模糊虚拟与现实的过程中，赋予大多数底层人从未意识到第四层枷锁，即赛博朋克式地将计算机幻化为穷人的假上帝。一边是智能机械弱化了劳动者的议价能力，另一边过剩的人力则被进一步地压缩至娱乐至死的虚拟幻境之中。从住房到医疗，资本的逐利性前所未有的暴露出来，甚至连教育这一社会阶层流动的血管也被这些癌细胞肆意地蚕食。 由是，觉醒意识开始从体力无产者蔓延至脑力无产者，许多被忽视已久的概念和思想得以重新审视。当资本高速发展可以些许惠及他们的时候，他们抛弃了这些概念；当资本无法容纳生产力进步所带来的群体诉求时，这些概念又在他们脑海中回归了。于是，无产阶级重新开始用“资本家”称呼企业家，用“剥削”描述雇佣；资本集团则深感不安，渴望再一次用其垄断的话术要求人们相信今天所遭受的生活困苦应当归咎于奋斗和劳动不够。但受到剥削的群体意识俨然在客观现实中导向了资本的掠夺本质，也唤起了拒绝为无序扩张的资本服务、为一小撮垄断资产阶级的“特权”卖命的抗争思潮，而后者正是在资本主义的叙事掩饰下，通过利润和税金等形式无偿地占有工人创造的大量财富，贪婪地榨取劳动人民的血汗。 这是资本无序扩张的第三十年，也是云谲波诡、山雨欲来的一年。资本的无序扩张正将历史唯物主义同广大的无产阶级重新耦合，敏锐的人们正向更先进的生产力和生产关系睁眼望去。 《去依附》温铁军 ↩︎

去意识形态化是本书的精髓。从序言开始，温教授便深入浅出地解构了当代经济学体系中西方话语体系的固有定势，并基于马克思主义政治经济学和几十年的本土研究成果阐述了数个振聋发聩的核心观点，以历史唯物主义精神力图还原被利益集团所扭曲的厚重历史。揆诸当下，百年未有之大变局下，各种黑天鹅、灰犀牛事件交织发生，国际竞争格局日益复杂，我国经济发展也到了新的攻坚期，书中对乡村振兴和城乡融合发展的思路对时下具有深刻的借鉴意义。 “工业化的背后必然有成本转嫁。”工业革命以来，工业化是各国现代化建设的主线，工业实力奠定了国家实力的基础，而工业化必然伴随着资本的原始积累。和中国类似的诸多后发独立国家在融入资本主义的世界生产体系后，为了获得建设的大量资金，不得不以牺牲部分主权来引入外部资本，而这种模式成为了后殖民主义时代老牌工业国家剥削它们的高明手段，在此类路径依赖中，发达国家得以将经济发展的成本与危机在开放市场的情境下转嫁给缺乏消化危机制度成本的后者，使得各国之间的马太效应更佳显著。 书中花费了大量篇幅分析新中国前三十年的工业化建设模式，从中可以清晰地认识到奠基我国重工业基础的代价是工农“剪刀差”和“全盘苏化”带来的部分权益之牺牲。通过举国动员和全国人民的辛苦建设，我们用农矿产品换来了开启工业化大门的最核心、最底层的支持，但也因为路径依赖在外交环境恶化后，在财政危机下迫不得已开展上山下乡运动。在这里，农村第一次展现了其化解城市危机的重要价值，为缺乏资本和技术的城市与供给过剩的知识分子提供了短暂的庇护所，“劳动力的集中投入成功地代替了长期绝对稀缺的资金，农村由其内生的稳定性成功地承接并化解了城市的危机”，深刻分析了当时我国的经济基础、上层建筑，特别是城乡生产关系对经济发展的影响。 城乡二元体制也是本书重点着墨的话题。温教授一针见血地指出我国“地方化”资源资本发展的客观事实。在很长时间内，地方的高度分权是央地财政分配体系的重要特征，“政府公司化”自1958年放权地方以来延续至今，使得政府成为经济活动中的另一重要引擎。而城乡二元结构带来的割裂，为工农产品“剪刀差”提供了社会条件。改革开放以来，广袤乡村的农民在非市场化制度下平均分配到无风险的资产，又将风险收益拱手让读于企业家和沿海发达地区的政府，他们为我国迈入社会主义市场经济体制亦做出了不可磨灭的贡献。“新中国成立后，农民仅通过这三种方式为国家建设积累资金就至少达到17.3万亿元”，可见“三农”在我国发展历程中的贡献如此之重。 回望当下，随着对外开放的进一步深入和金融资本同经济社会更深层的嵌合，为了防范化解重大危机，实现可持续发展，解决好“三农”问题成为时代的新命题。新世纪以来，资本相较于产业不断过剩，旧的经济发展主义向更为绿色、科学的精细化模式转变。进入免除了农业税的“后税费时代”，农业人口结构的老龄化所引发的劳动力稀缺危机弱化了农村的社会调节功能，如何以生态文明建设引领农村新型工业化和城镇化，将山水资源以货币形式自我资本化，将广袤农村的自然要素锚定于更具流通性的价值度量，推动城乡产业融合发展、促进商品流通和农村内需延扩，都是更为实质性的问题。而在知识阶层再一次渐趋过剩的今天，除了城市服务业蓄水池之外，如何进一步发挥好农村在解决产能和劳动力匹配性问题的作用，也是令人值得深思的问题。

王岐山：政协常委会披露中央对反腐败的思考1昨天（2014年8月25日）下午，中央纪委书记王岐山的出席让全国政协例行的常委会别开生面。这是政协十二届全国委员会常务委员会第七次会议，主要议题是围绕“深入落实八项规定精神，以优良的党风政风带动民风社风”建言献策。会上，王岐山脱稿就反腐败作了1小时10分钟报告后，又与8位政协常委互动问答。察时局研究发现，此次会议有3个首创：这不仅是中央纪委书记首次出席全国政协常委会，也是政协常委会首次将反腐败作为会议主题；另外，会上还首次设置互动问答环节。而在以往全国政协常委会上，并未有过中央纪委书记出席并做报告的先例。 王岐山首先对自己的到来做了背景介绍。他说：“我在中央政治局常委会讨论政协工作时，提了个建议——政协会议应该有一个谈反腐倡廉的议政话题——得到总书记支持；俞正声主席就邀请我到政协来做这个报告，他说，既然是你提议的，就由您老人家来讲。没辙！就这么着，来了。既然是政治协商，要发挥民主监督的作用，政协的监督反腐倡廉工作就应该是一个重要课题。十八大以来，我们党在习总书记的领导下，在治党、治国、治军等方面，所取得的成效是有目共睹的。谋篇开张，应该说基本都做到位了。我今天不讲太多，先从八项规定这个话题切入。我说的话的作用和功效是什么呢——就是一个“话引子”（编者注：北京方言，与“药引子”、“面引子”一个系列，意为抛砖引玉），然后请大家讨论，发表真知灼见。” 王岐山讲了一个小插曲。2013年3月22日，王岐山会见美国前国务卿亨利·基辛格时，据当时新华社发出的新闻提到，王岐山“向客人介绍了中国共产党的纪律检查工作”。会上，王岐山向全体政协常委生动描述了当时见面场景：基辛格问我：“你到底管什么了？”我说，我管8300万中共党员的纪律问题。8300万是一个相当于中等偏大国家的人口规模。基辛格说：“这是一个伟大的工作”。我理解他的话不像是好话，而是在调侃我——伟大的工作，是指什么意思呢？就是说我做不到，管不住……说到这里，王岐山话锋一转：我的观点就是从严管党，从严治党，这就是我的信条。王岐山在时隔一年半以后，用中共近一年多来的反腐成就回应了基辛格的调侃。 王岐山谈了为什么反腐要从八项规定入手：反腐不能面面俱到，而是要立竿见影。八项规定是很具体的，一点都不抽象，而且政治局常委就带头遵守。中央过去不知有过多少规定，但都是不了了之；所以这次我们做这个工作，就是要从实际出发、从具体入手，只有这样才能抓得住、抓得牢，而现实是非常严峻的。八项规定出台以后，在各地引发的反应令我很吃惊。各地的政研室闻风而动，我们共产党的机关是不缺政研室的。政研室把电脑里的文件调出来，七改八改就出台一堆规定，根本没有“抠”住八项规定的具体条文及实质。因此，各地反映说，这些规定太快、太宽、太严。我问他们：你们做得到吗？坚持得了吗？这是为什么？就是因为，他们认为这还是一阵风、刮过去就算完了，没有认识到这是关乎人心向背、是作风根本转变的宝贵机会。2013年两会期间，我们开始抓这个事儿，仅仅是牛刀小试，还要更快更严地落实。大家都要认识到，这是关乎到党的生死存亡的大事，中国共产党能不能坚持做到八项规定的承诺，能不能兑现自己的承诺，是一个非常重要的问题。我想，我们要“扭住”这个事情。做具体工作的时候，我们还想了一些办法。去年“五一”长假到来之前，我们让中纪委约谈各部委，我找了两个单位亲自约谈，财政部和国资委。这两个部委领导来了之后，拿了一大堆文件，说财政部系统怎么样怎么样，国资委系统怎么样怎么样。我说你们甭跟我谈系统，你们就谈谈你们办公大楼里这点事儿，我就要看你们自己是怎么落实八项规定的。 还有一个关于月饼和贺年卡的故事，王岐山说：在今年八月份到来之前，我在中央政治局常委会上提出了月饼问题，得到总书记很好的呼应。月饼是个小事儿，但困扰我们大家很久的一个问题是，我在北京当市长的时候就发现，月饼已经和交通有联系了，从东城送西城，西城送北城，转圈儿送。而且，送来送去，发现篮子里变得无奇不有。月饼篮子里有手机、有钱、有金银首饰。我还专门去天津走访了月饼厂，他们反映，月饼越做越贵，鎏金的、包金的，里面放这放那的，越来越不像话。以后新年到来之前，我们要开抓贺卡。贺年卡也是越做越不像话，常委的压力很大，每个人得写三百多张。我在常委会说了这个事之后，下午就通过了这个决议，大家都很支持。习总书记在提出八项规定之后，开始提出公私要分明。有很多事情很具体，比方说要出差，走哪就在哪儿吃。总书记说，我们要不要交钱？交多少钱？你八项规定这么细致，就是要求公私要分明。政治局常委的工作也越来越细，2013年常委开始联系省一级，到2014年常委开始联系县，由易到难、由浅入深。总书记说，我们八项规定的落实，应该是作为一个名片（业绩），是本届中央委员会向十九届中央委员会的一个交代。总书记说完之后，我听明白了，这事儿我得抓五年。 王岐山在谈到八项规定查处问题时，又诙谐了一把。他说：我现在下去，或者省、市委领导到我这儿来，跟我称兄道弟，唱赞歌，说现在是（吃喝）真不想了。我说你们真不想了？也不想吃了，也不想喝了，真的不想了？哪儿那么简单啊！我还想吃想喝呢！就像戒烟戒酒一样，能一下就不抽、不喝啦？所以不要那么急着说“不想”，我觉得我们现在把“不敢”和“不能”做到就行了。我现在可以负责任地说，“不敢”这条已经初见成效。这次我到政协来，就想给大家出个题目，让大家帮我一起研究一下怎么能做到“不能”？从“不敢”阶段向“不能”阶段迈进。过去，北京东华门有家专门做潮州菜的JNN餐厅，很好吃，我以前很喜欢，那时我在建行当行长，没少去。中纪委那时候是尉健行同志抓，他就派人在门口蹲守，拍车牌子，曝光，抄了三个月车牌以后，这个店关张了。 谈到反腐中的舆论监督和社会监督，王岐山说：为什么能做到“不敢”呢？我觉得监督作用发挥了很重要的效果。过去，我们都是自上而下来监督，现在颠倒了，由于有微博、微信、媒体的监督，现在是从下而上，不一样了，现在网上的反应非常的迅速，非常普及，而且（对公款大吃大喝）一直能拍到屋里。听说有的媒体是给了稿费、给好处费的，你能帮我拍到哪个官吃饭、哪个单位的发票，给你多少多少钱，所以把服务人员的积极性都调动起来了。所以他们真拍啊！加大了惩处的力度。（对腐败问题）我们中纪委坚持一条，就是曝光。省长、书记跟我讲，岐山同志，你怎么处理都行，就是别给我曝光。我说，就是不处理也得曝你的光。到目前为止，中纪委已经曝光全国查处违反中央八项规定精神问题51600起，涉及人员67600多人，非常有效。所以在这一点上，我们要坚定不移发挥监督的功能和作用。习近平总书记说，党的作风问题是一个大问题，弄不好就成了一堵墙，把人民和党分隔开了，把党组织和群众分隔开了。

央广网正在美国访问的国家主席习近平，在西雅图当地政府和友好团体联合举办的欢迎晚宴上，面向全体美国人民发表了重要演讲。习近平说：“上个世纪60年代末，我才十几岁，就从北京到中国陕西省延安市一个叫梁家河的小村子，我到那去当了农民。那时候，我和乡亲们都住在土窑里、睡在土炕上，乡亲们生活十分的困苦，经常是几个月吃不到一块肉。我了解乡亲们最需要什么！后来，我就当了这个村子里的党支部书记。我很期盼的一件事，就是让乡亲们饱餐一顿肉，并且经常吃上肉。但是，这个心愿在当时是难以实现的。今年春节，我又回到这个乡村梁家河。梁家河现在不一样了，修了柏油马路，乡亲们住上了砖瓦房，用上了互联网，老人们享有基本养老，村民们有医疗保险，孩子们可以受到良好的教育，当然吃肉已经不是一个问题。梁家河这个小村庄的变化是改革开放以来，中国经济社会发展的一个缩影。 ”在美国人眼中，习近平也是位“打虎”高手，但部分美国人怀疑习主席打虎的动机，对此，习主席说：“我说过，打铁还需本身硬。这里说的打铁的人，就是中国共产党。如果我们不能解决存在的问题，任其发展下去，人民就不会信任和支持我们，一段时间以来，我们坚持‘老虎’、‘苍蝇’一起打，就是要顺应人民要求。这其中没有什么权力斗争，没有什么‘纸牌屋’。 ”

十八届中纪委六次全会的讲话我们坚定不移反对腐败，使我们占据了国际道义制高点。过去，美国等西方国家总想用反腐败问题来拿捏我们，不断在联合国、二十国集团、亚太经合组织等场合提出所谓反腐败问题。现在，我们在国际上一举转为战略主动。我们加强反腐败国际多边双边合作，启动“天网行动”，加大追逃追赃力度，将一批外逃多年的犯罪分子缉拿归案。我们主动提出一系列反腐败国际合作倡议，倡议构建国际反腐新秩序，特别是加大对美国等西方国家在反腐败合作方面的压力，要求他们不要成为腐败分子的“避罪天堂”。原来他们认为那些犯罪嫌疑人是他们手中的牌，现在都成了手里的烫山芋。各方面对我们敢于向腐败亮剑是佩服的，我们的反腐行动赢得了国际社会尊重。 从党的十八大以来查处的中管干部违纪违法案件看，腐败分子往往集政治蜕变、经济贪婪、生活腐化、作风专横于一身。党的十八大以来，党中央反复强调领导干部要严守政治纪律和政治规矩，但有的置若罔闻，搞结党营私、拉帮结派、团团伙伙，一门心思钻营权力；有的明知在换届中组织没有安排他，仍派亲信到处游说拉票，搞非组织活动；有的政治野心不小，扬言“活着要进中南海，死了要入八宝山”；有的在其主政的地方建“独立王国”，搞小山头、拉小圈子，对党中央决策部署阳奉阴违，为实现个人政治野心而不择手段。这些问题是关系党和国家政治安全的大问题，难道还不是政治吗？还用得着闪烁其词、讳莫如深吗？“新松恨不高千尺，恶竹应须斩万竿。”如果不除恶务尽，一有风吹草动就会死灰复燃、卷土重来，不仅恶化政治生态，更会严重损害党心民心。有人说，如果这一次还是出现反弹、出现回潮，那人民就失望了。所以，军令状不是随便立的，我们说到就要做到。 勿以善小而不为，勿以恶小而为之。如果开始就咬耳朵、扯袖子，在执纪方面抓得很紧，可以让多少人避免违法？过去形成了这么一种现象，就是不到违法的程度大家都可以“包容”、“宽容”，到了违法就由他去吧。这是对党和干部不负责任的表现。有权就有责，权责要对等。问责不能感情用事，不能有怜悯之心，要“较真”、“叫板”，发挥震慑效应。前年，我们对湖南衡阳发生的以贿赂手段破坏选举案件严肃问责，给予党纪政纪处分467人，移送司法机关处理69人。去年，我们又对南充拉票贿选案进行彻底调查，对全部477名涉案人员严肃处理。这两起案件性质极为恶劣，是对我们党和社会主义民主制度的挑战。 这里，我还要强调一下家风问题。从近年来查处的腐败案件看，家风败坏往往是领导干部走向严重违纪违法的重要原因。不少领导干部不仅在前台大搞权钱交易，还纵容家属在幕后收钱敛财，子女等也利用父母影响经商谋利、大发不义之财。有的将自己从政多年积累的“人脉”和“面子”，用在为子女非法牟利上，其危害不可低估。古人说：“将教天下，必定其家，必正其身。”“莫用三爷，废职亡家。”“心术不可得罪于天地，言行要留好样与儿孙。”在年前的中央政治局专题民主生活会上，我专门强调了这个问题。我说，我在这里跟大家语重心长嘱咐，要操这点心，家里那点事有时不经意可能就溜过去了，要留留神，防微杜渐，不要护犊子。干部子弟也要遵纪守法，不要以为是干部子弟就谁都奈何不了了。触犯了党纪国法都要处理，而且要从严处理，做给老百姓看。 2012年12月，我在中央政治局会议审议八项规定时就说过，我们不舒服一点、不自在一点，老百姓的舒适度就好一点、满意度就高一点，对我们的感觉就好一点。我说过“两面人”的问题，大量案件表明，党内有一些人在这方面问题很突出。有的修身不真修、信仰不真信，很会伪装，喜欢表演作秀，表里不一、欺上瞒下，说一套、做一套，台上一套、台下一套，当面一套、背后一套，手腕高得很；有的公开场合要党员、干部坚定理想信念，背地里自己不敬苍生敬鬼神，笃信风水、迷信“大师”；有的口头上表态坚定不移反腐败，背地里对涉及领导干部的问题线索不追问、不报告；有的张口“廉洁”、闭口“清正”，私底下却疯狂敛财。这种口是心非的“两面人”，对党和人民事业危害很大，必须及时把他们辨别出来、清除出去。 当前，党内集中不够和民主不够的问题同时存在。有的软弱涣散，我行我素、各行其是，党的路线方针政策落实不到位；有的独断专行，搞家长制、“一言堂”，个人凌驾于组织之上，党内民主得不到充分保障，领导干部特别是一把手的权力受不到有效制约。不能“你有你的关门计，我有我的跳墙法”。强化党内监督，必须坚持、完善、落实民主集中制，把民主基础上的集中和集中指导下的民主有机结合起来，把上级对下级、同级之间以及下级对上级的监督充分调动起来，确保党内监督落到实处、见到实效。 批评和自我批评存在的普遍性问题是，自我批评难，相互批评更难。难就难在为人情所困、为利益所惑，怕结怨树敌、怕引火烧身，说到底还是私心杂念作怪，缺乏党性和担当。“反听之谓聪，内视之谓明，自胜之谓强。”对自己的缺点错误，要敢于正视、主动改正。对别人的缺点错误，要敢于指出、帮助改进。对同志的提醒批评，要闻过则喜、虚心接受。自我批评要一日三省，相互批评要随时随地，不要等小毛病发展成大问题再提。要让批评和自我批评成为党内生活的常态，成为每个党员、干部的必修课。 这两年，各级领导班子民主生活会的质量有了一定提高，但走过场的问题仍很突出。民主生活会要及时开，遇到重要问题或普遍性问题，需要集体批评和自我批评的，就要召开民主生活会，把事情说清楚、谈透彻。有了群众反映，接到揭发检举，经过查核确有轻微违规违纪行为，就要让犯错误的同志在民主生活会上自我检讨，大家批评帮助，共同敲响警钟。对巡视反馈的领导干部“四风”问题和违反廉洁纪律问题，要在民主生活会上进行剖析批评，提出整改措施。上级党组织要加强对下级领导班子民主生活会的督促指导，提高民主生活会质量和水平。 随着反腐败斗争持续深入，社会上出现了一些值得注意的舆论倾向和氛围。有几种论调还很有些市场，比如，反腐同群众利益无关，反腐让干部不作为，反腐影响经济发展，反腐是权力斗争，反腐应当缓缓手，等等。对这些模糊认识和错误言论，必须加以辨析、引导，驳斥错误言论，化解消极情绪，消除偏见误解，说清楚我们党反腐败不是看人下菜的“势利店”，不是争权夺利的“纸牌屋”，也不是有头无尾的“烂尾楼”，从而为深入开展党风廉政建设和反腐败斗争营造良好舆论氛围。

一段时间以来，党内政治生活不认真不严肃现象比较普遍，庸俗化、随意化倾向比较突出，少数地方和单位政治生态严重恶化，甚至出现了系统性、塌方式腐败。主要问题是：从组织和组织的关系看，有的党组织违背“四个服从”原则，有令不行、有禁不止，对党中央和上级的决策部署合意的就执行、不合意的就不执行；一些上级党组织对下级放弃管党治党责任，甚至发现问题也一味姑息迁就、放任自流。从个人和组织的关系看，有的党员、干部党的意识弱化、组织观念淡薄，不相信组织、不服从组织、不依靠组织，把党组织当成了来去自由的“大车店”、各取所需的“大卖场”、自行其是的“私人俱乐部”；有的领导班子成员特别是一把手不正确理解和执行民主集中制，搞家长制、一言堂或自由主义、分散主义、宗派主义，有的甚至把所在地方和分管领域当作“独立王国”、“私人领地”；有的党组织对党员、干部管理失之于宽、失之于松、失之于软。从个人和个人的关系看，有的党员、干部讲利益不讲党性、讲关系不讲原则、讲面子不讲规矩，甚至把党内同志关系异化为人身依附关系，搞小山头、小圈子、小团伙那一套，搞门客、门宦、门附那一套；更为严重的是，党内出现了周永康、薄熙来、郭伯雄、徐才厚、令计划等人，他们结党营私、篡党夺权，骄奢淫逸、贪赃枉法，严重污染了党内政治生态，造成了极为恶劣的政治影响。 一些影响党内政治生活、政治生态的消极因素尚未根除，一些深层次矛盾和问题尚未根本解决，一些老问题死灰复燃、反弹回潮的隐患依然存在。特别是意识形态领域的斗争更加尖锐复杂，一些负面的东西还会不断侵蚀和渗透到党内政治生活中来。同时，党内状况也在不断发生变化，党员队伍的来源构成、思想观念、价值取向、利益诉求等日益多样化，给严肃党内政治生活提出了许多新课题。 严肃党内生活，最根本的是认真执行党的民主集中制，着力解决发扬民主不够、正确集中不够、开展批评不够、严肃纪律不够等问题。要健全和认真落实民主集中制的各项具体制度，促使全党同志按照民主集中制办事，促使各级领导干部特别是主要领导干部带头执行民主集中制。要发扬党内民主，营造民主讨论的良好氛围，鼓励讲真话、讲实话、讲心里话，允许不同意见碰撞和争论，同时善于进行正确集中，防止议而不决、决而不行。

一群信仰者的韧性韧性是共产党人的名片，并贯穿于近代民主主义革命史始终。诚然，建党之初的先行者们有如陈公博、李达、李汉俊等人数年内便脱党，或如刘仁静、张国焘等人被党开除，能够历经锤炼直达新中国成立的却是寥寥无几。“历史命运蜕变为个人命运，众生便只有在周易八卦面前诚惶诚恐。”建立之初的中国共产党在那个每天都有无数松散的政治组织或军事派系起起落落的年代似乎并不显眼，甚至连发起者都难以预料她的前程。她诞生于凄风苦雨，在乱世的客观环境与统治者苛政的制约下，信仰恰恰成为了弥足珍贵的事物。如周恩来同志感慨，“敌人可以在三五分钟内消灭我们的领袖，我们却无法在三五年内将他们造就出来”。正是在这样残酷而冷峻的时代氛围之中，选择这个政党意味着向危险且不确定的未来宣战，而他们的唯一武器便是从日本、俄国传来的星星点点的崭新理论；也正是在此种历程之间，共产党人从先行的觉醒者们蜕变为信仰坚毅、意志坚韧的阶级斗士。 分散的地理分布与统一集中的精神内核塑造了共产党极其团结的韧性。先进的思想即革命的火种，无论是“砍头不要紧，只要主义真”慷慨赴死的英勇烈士，还是一趟一趟为上海党中央运送黄金物资的苏区根据地，星罗棋布的组织在广袤的群众中吸纳同志，在最现代化的城市联合先进知识分子阶层源源不断地翻译印刷革命的理论。漫长的斗争征程，更是在意见的分野、路线的分歧中愈发成熟。从工人暴动到真正拿起枪杆子进行武装斗争，从租界的地下活动到扎根于贫困落后的边区山区，毛泽东所开辟的“武装斗争、农村包围城市”之路以其同中国现实的紧密契合成为了革命历程的鲜明主线。 不可计数的无名英雄们亦是红色政权韧性品质的具象展现。蒋介石步步紧逼的围剿催生出了朱德等一批青史留名的将领。陈毅将军后来回忆道：“朱总司令在最黑暗的日子里，在群众情绪低到零度、灰色丧气的时候，指出了光明的前途，增加了群众的革命信念。这是总司令的伟大。”而在隐蔽战线，以李克农为代表的无名英雄们深刻诠释了何为谍报高手，他们出生入死，每日同恐惧与压抑打交道早已不值得诉说，高尚的理想与精妙的战术甚至永远得不到普罗大众的一滴热泪。的确，多如牛毛的赴死者之中有人经受不住严刑拷打，可涌现出的大多数至死忠于敌人看来虚无缥缈的远大理想的坚毅灵魂，放眼整个世界千百年来，本身就是最大的奇迹，这无疑是应当永恒铭记的。

历史转折中的长征长征并非红军的本意，“长征”一词本身甚至出自蒋介石之口，并被用于形容追截红军的国军士兵。然而，正是这场起源于反围剿失败、旷日持久的“战略转移”，让中共从危难之中谋生存跨越性地居于赢得独立、解放全国的新坐标。 一方面，长征塑造了毛泽东、周恩来等一批执政精英。长征前夕，国民党中统协调清除了中共上海某地下组织，瘫痪其电报系统，使得长征前期党无法同苏联取得直接联系。而正是在长征期间，曾短暂失去权力的毛泽东同志在遵义会议的历史节点上取得了领导地位，纠正了顶着中共中央和红军负责人头衔的博古、李德以及共产国际的许多错误指示，并带领着麾下的红四军取得节节胜利。也无怪乎金一南教授如此评价：“一部电台竟使历史突然间改变了走向，这是一九三四年的博古、李德、毛泽东，以及在上海忙于搜查的国民党秘密警察们，谁都不曾想到的。”然而质变分割历史，变革总是寓于长期的斗争积累之中。中央苏区中央局早已多次对共产国际的指示表达反对，许多党内同志亦对其代言人博古等人不满甚久，正是长征的契机，使得量变促成了质变。与之类似，张国焘的“另立中央”也在长征实践中终结，中国共产党实现了新生。 另一方面，长征更加速了中共的成熟，为其走向全国性胜利奠定了不可磨灭的基础。根据埃德加·斯诺的调查，红军成员以农民青年为主，他们惊人的忠诚度体现在伤亡率50%的情况下仍然保持战斗力，而一般军队在伤亡率超过5%时就会溃散。长征的苦难恰恰铸就了红军的辉煌，毛泽东、周恩来、彭德怀等人的智慧才能于此更为凸显，中国共产党的韧性也于此更加深远地奠基。

红色政权何以存在从南湖红船上不起眼的寥寥数人到夺得新民主主义革命伟大胜利，这支红色政权如何屹立中国政治舞台中央并领导着她实现民族复兴、国家崛起的宏大目标、迈向社会主义、共产主义的理想征程？事实上，国民党一大召开伊始，中共就展现出其卓越超凡的组织能力，这无疑是一个政党组织壮大的首要因素。彼时，这一刚刚成立三年的政党便已开始为前方的探索者提供自身的政治智慧了。 作为党的三大法宝之一，武装斗争始终是革命的第一要义。如马克思所言，“批判的武器永远代替不了武器的批判”，若要在军阀割据的黑暗世代摧毁旧社会的腐朽大厦，作为硬实力的军事要素必然置于一个革命组织奠基性的位置。这也是中国共产党在工人暴动受到残酷镇压的教训中逐步总结而来的。而历史永远无法忘记的更是那些斗争锤炼中的巨人们——“彭德怀是一团火，一团从里烧到外，随时准备摧枯拉朽的烈火；林彪则是一潭水，一潭深不可测却含而不露的静水”，鞠躬尽瘁的周总理在革命期间展现出令人惊叹的情报工作才能，改革开放的总设计师邓小平也曾千里跃进大别山……群雄闪耀背后，教员的话更是振聋发聩：“革命不是请客吃饭……革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的暴烈行动。” 此外，群众路线指引下的中共正确地找到了自身的历史站位，即代表无产阶级，之于中国大地特别是包括农民、工人在内的广大底层劳动者的利益，向新旧交织的地主、军阀与官僚资本家等统治者宣战，并顺应时势变化笼络部分知识分子阶层与民族资产阶级，代表中华民族的整体利益向日本侵略者及其他西方列强殖民者宣战。“每一次轰轰烈烈的大革命都是对历史的颠倒，也是一次对人们原本位置的颠倒”，鲜明的阶级立场给予了红军战士最为明晰的目标，也阐释了“谁是我们敌人，谁是我们的朋友”这一革命的首要问题。 严明的纪律、民主的作风则共同构成了中共扎根华夏广袤大地的充分条件。无论是解放前硝烟弥漫的战场还是在天安门城楼宣布“中国人民从此站立起来了”之后的建设时期，人民军队都保持着其不变的子弟兵底色。书中提及，红军的“三大纪律、八项注意”与“不拿群众一针一线”的优良作风令群众印象深刻，红军进驻农村时，许多农民还会自发地组成委员会为他们提供帮助，年轻的人们则对参加这支充满了理想与民主、平等氛围的军队十分踊跃。此外，红军在苏区的分地政策也切实地反映了她的性质与宗旨。而民主的作风在那个封建礼教尚未褪去、军阀体系下等级日趋森严的时代更显得珍贵且富有吸引力。党内民主的发扬使得军队上下级之间的传统隔阂被有效地瓦解了，在组织之内，没有人可以颐指气使，也没有人可以如许多国民党军阀们一般利欲熏心、尊卑显著。从上到下不讳言的批评与自我批评，框架清晰的党内选举制度，以及规章面前人人平等的纪律处分体系，显著地提升了这支庞大队伍的凝聚力和战斗力。战士们洞察着的不仅是此刻的局势，更是一个尚未到达的理想社会、一个具象的赶跑侵略者和旧统治者的奋斗目标。

唯物的笔调“历史的奥妙，在于它可以包括无穷无尽的假设。历史的冷峻，又在于它总把假设永远置于假设。”详尽的叙事笔调事无巨细地展现出20世纪上半叶的种种细节，巧妙地铺陈也使得作者的观点态度含蓄内敛，即他希望通过客观事实的组合引导读者于此抽离出辩证的判断。徜徉其中，方才知道，周恩来同志曾“人生中唯一一次拍桌子”与张国焘据理力争，国共第一次合作中，在当代被中共推崇为革命先行者的孙中山也多次设计限制共产党的壮大，军事战略的伟人毛泽东同志亦在遵义会议后经历过多次败仗的挫折，博古与其背后的共产国际提名李德在很大意义上出于对打压中国本土的党员精英的政治考量；更为重要的是，即便是苏联也曾更为支持国民党却又极力控制中国共产党以致后者的成员从“苏共中国党支部”的调侃转变为长征路上对前者政策的强烈反对…… “从来就没有什么救世主，也不靠神仙皇帝；要创造人类的幸福，全靠我们自己。”一幕幕苦难与辉煌及其内在逻辑联系正是对历史唯物主义的最好印证。高山仰止指向的那群无论多么光芒万丈、高瞻远瞩的英雄们，亦是最广大人民群众的重要一员。人无完人，历史也绝非精心设计的完美剧本。“一个政党、一个社团独立与否，并不在起领导人的主观意念如何，而在于是否具备客观条件。”由是，在共产国际指派的决策者的次次错误之后，秋收起义、农村根据地应运而生；在对苏联不切实际指示的不满情绪不断积累之后，毛泽东代表的本土战略家们在长征中逐一登上舞台中央。

成大事者“苦难来源于物质的困境和探寻的艰难，辉煌则来源于精神的强大和追求的实践。”《苦难辉煌》所刻画的众多历史人物在浩浩汤汤的时代大潮中烙下鲜明的印迹。 新中国的缔造者——毛泽东同志在长征中的重要作用在作者的笔下得到了充分的展现。他不仅写下了《星星之火，可以燎原》《论持久战》等旷世巨著，更作为最高指挥者，在一次次的胜负交叠中灵活应变。他不避讳错误，虽然在遵义会议后的头两次战斗中遭受失败，也曾被彭德怀、林彪等前线指挥员异议，可这仍旧无法掩盖他的军事才能和辩证思维，特别是运用机动的战术迅速弥补了先前的漏洞，带领全军在四渡赤水中夺得胜利。 与之相较，那些半途而废之流如此黯淡。我们确然无法苛责每一位沉浮于历史长河的小人物拥有如此完美的成就，可他们老泪纵横、悔恨不已的结局也警示着当代渴望实现理想的人们如何避免埋没于平凡的大多数中。龚楚，从工农运动、井冈山到红军长征，原本较高的资历与优秀的军事本领让他一度有望载入史册，然而他最终沦为了助纣为虐的叛徒。 如若那些失败者能够预见未来的结局，便能摇身一变成为英雄的一员吗？在我看来，答案显然是否定的。真正的成大事者不拘泥于成功道途上的每一次选择，恰恰相反，是他们自身的内在品质成就了他们的伟业。缺乏坚定信仰、坚毅意志、正义立场或是优秀才能的前者，只会如蒋介石般在彻底的失败后不甘地在日记中埋怨、在对历史的假设中沉沦。

结语时至今日，为什么我们仍然需要《苦难辉煌》？ 叱咤风云的人物纷纷消失之后，历史便成为一笔巨大的遗产，完整无损地留给了我们。可并不是每个人都能“以短暂的生命辉映漫长的历史”，历史是兴衰，也是命运。 因而，如今身为后人的我们复鉴历史，须知解构苦难，才能建构辉煌。当筚路蓝缕的红军战士使光鲜体面的党国将领都不得不为之气折，他们历历在目的艰难险阻便散发出应有的光辉。与此同时，有太多太多的英雄在胜利的前夜倒下，他们无法触及的永恒目标，则是后辈最值得承续的伟大事业。 最后，正如金一南先生感慨，机缘、时运、窍门从来不属于这个事业，只有依靠不屈不挠的坚韧、义无反顾的坚强、前仆后继的牺牲，我们才能在从革命、建设到改革的漫长征程中披荆斩棘，铸就辉煌。愿共勉！

《美国工厂》效率与福利中被忽视的阶级内因“866票反对，444票支持。”这是《美国工厂》摄影镜头下、2017年11月夜晚的福耀美国工厂，其董事长曹德旺与其他管理层人员正为他们所面对的汽车工会支持下的工会动议投票之胜利庆幸。在这场糅合了中美企业文化乃至劳资集团异质价值观冲撞的对决背后，不仅是美国传统制造业外移与机械化智能化趋势下工人阶级所面临的一般胁迫所致，更不应忽视的是正如马克思数百年前所解构的资本主义生产方式下，相对缺席的阶级革命所塑造的具有利益集团性质的美式工会、新自由主义主导下劳资关系纠纷解决的独特机制与其不相称的全球分工格局所占地位，上述被掩盖的三者却恰恰是当代以市场经济为主导的国家资本主义或自由资本主义国家的共性矛盾，即笼统概括工会本身的异化、资本对效率的失衡掌控与工人被机器不断挤占的价值地位中总和的阶级矛盾。而福耀集团内的斗争不过是两种异质体系共有的阶级性局限的集中表现，工会动议的否决亦是现行架构下的无奈产物，没有一方可以宣称自己的真正胜利，尽管它从某种意义上为去传统、无人化的新兴经济基础提供了前所未有的生产方式或仅仅是企业管理模式的微小探索。 人们通过一定的生产关系生产出商品，而生产关系本身也由人们所产出。物质生产率或曰生产力正是这一关系的决定性基础。由是，一瞥纪录片中展现的中美所谓劳资关系及企业文化差异，实质是两种不同经济模式的外现。坐拥高附加值产业并傲居制造链顶端的美利坚合众国，在劳工与企业主的长期斡旋中派生出一套庞大而职业化的工会集团，而这反过来契合了工人们觉醒的福利与平等意识。然而，前者作为资产阶级与无产阶级达成妥协的调和手段，将美国工人们的权利意识局限于更好地待遇而非不合理的生产关系本身。这恰恰瓦解了工人们的同盟心理，于是，年轻工人们担心被解雇而不愿投赞成票、许多工人为管理层的临时涨薪政策而放弃组建工会的斗争等消极化的群体现象便不足为奇。从无产阶级的斗争角度而言，这部影片无疑以冷峻的视角揭露了当代劳资价值极其不对称关系下工人们的艰难处境，即便是工会文化异常强盛的拥趸者们，也不得不屈服于无人制造和低端制造业逃逸背景下的价值弱化现实。 然而，影片所展现的工会本身，也正如前述不足以称为阶级斗争的切实工具。显然，分工、信用等资产阶级生产关系并非永恒或固定，无论从宏观视角审视美国置于全球分工体系下向高端制造业的角色转变、脱实向虚的经济结构，还是从美国“温和的左翼”与保守派妥协下的具有美国特色的劳资关系委员会及工会制度入手，工人们事实上只能够面临被绑架的极化选项——跟随工会孕育的利益集团或是中国资本家。投票前夕抱怨着“工会只会留下那些懒惰无能的工人”的反对者们，与担心被工会接管后丧失自主管理权的福耀美国高层们惊奇地达成了一致的诉求，因而人们不得不重新审视表观架构下的真实生产关系。正如前文所言，工会实质成为了工人们的寄生者，对他们（包括游说者）而言，工人们不过是一种能以温和方式分一杯羹、实质却依然是剥夺所谓剩余价值的异己阶级。由是，真正令当代工人阶级感到恐惧甚至并未意识到的弊病便显而易见了，当更加高端的精密机械乃至可能大范围代替人类的自动化设备投入时，就像片尾管理者们漫不经心谈及的“准备用机器换掉那几个人”那样，工人们面对的只有双向的转型逼迫，进退维谷的选择不可避免地构成了新的矛盾，即他们逐渐成为“没落的一代”，甚至将成为无足轻重的、所在阶级的边缘者。 《美国工厂》揭示的也许并不只是中美两国不同劳资文化之间的矛盾及磨合过程。正如资产阶级的制度和封建制度一样由其内生的对抗因素构成，这部影片真实的表现了生产力仍在革新的今天，传统工人岌岌可危的地位、旧劳资关系和工会制度面临的必然对抗冲突在生产关系应运变革的内在规律作用下，正经历一种全新的磨合与调整过程。牢固掌控着员工管理权的福耀美国工厂在可预见的将来难以解决糟糕的生产环境，事实上，自动化技术的发展反倒为其提供了代替乃至消灭人工的新思路，在这条道路上，工人们的话语权进一步被削弱了；而工会的失败并非工人自身的失败，也是这一群实质上在阻碍先进生产力发展的、明显带有利益集团性质的效率蚕食者们的即将到来的失败。而对福耀企业来说，它自始至终没有摆脱市场竞争下的效率约束，在传统无产阶级逐步让位的当下，他所代表的垄断资产阶级们内部的进一步分化可能所要塑造的只是一种更难以寻求共赢方案的未来。而在遥远的大洋彼岸，一批辛劳的工人可能正在走着从自身成本上涨到价值没落的类同道路。

论“资本”“商品流通是资本的起点。”正如马克思在《资本论》中所言，资本是商品经济社会的自然派生物，同时又在漫长的物品贸易进程中将自身属性赋予原本以买入为价值导向的货币，由是，商品交易行为在其大规模的流通中发生了本质的改变——货币不再仅仅充当物品交换的传统媒介，而是在交易运动中自发地扮演其内生之利润的产出载体。 非等价交换的现实使得商品交易之中普遍存在着剩余价值，愈发复杂的经济关系使得每一个体频繁地进行着买者与卖者的身份交换，因而在商品本身价值并未发生实质性改变的前提下，其价格表现出普遍的偏差。然而，商品的流通本身总体上无法实现价值的增殖,交易运动的承担着们并非琳琅满目商品的使用价值的直接受众，恰恰相反，这一群体悄然地被活动本身抽象为资本的忠实执行工具，由是，“资本家”——将抽象财富作为经济活动唯一动机的身份被他所使用的工具孕育出来。从一方面说，资本家是资本化的货币的人格化外现；另一方面，货币在属性跃迁中实现了价值增殖的外生工具化过程。 在上述过程中，资本的生息使得商品、货币的流通循环为其本身构建了正反馈演化的“大动脉”。物与商品的简单接触在货币的普遍介入后使得后者羽化为资本的流通形式，由是产生了价值锚定上的固然矛盾。挣脱了物品使用价值的单一锚定对象，资本的增殖必然依托新的能够创造价值的环节或对象以完成自身的不断扩张，而劳动力恰恰是其最佳的选择。俾众周知，工业革命与其早期萌发的西欧国家曾发生的圈地运动等历史事件正不可阻挡地为欧洲这一天然地贸易社会创造出大量的剩余劳动力，而后者在消耗以支付生活资料成本为基础的工资收入后，凭借劳动技能、体力等产出的溢出价值表现出资本本身的生产过程。然而，货币的主要持有群体与真正创造劳动产品的工人们的沟壑却在这一过程中愈发显著。 马克思认为，商品的价值量本身取决于社会必要劳动时间。商品价值区别于使用价值，在于其被引入于包含货币流通的贸易环节中需要实现卖出这一“惊险的跳跃”，然而庞大经济系统内部的竞争迫使生产者们首先着眼于个体劳动效率的提升。在同等生产水平之下，劳动对象的工作时间在不断的内卷中肆意增长；与此同时，逐步提升的生产效率也反过来压缩着社会必要的劳动时间。在这一矛盾、持续的运动中，剩余价值的体量暴露地更加无疑——产品价值的产出对于生产资料和劳动力投入的差值更多地进入那些投入货币的资本家手中。 值得注意的是，尽管资本天然的扩张属性与劳动过程中剩余价值的产出具有共生的一面，然而，鉴于资本的不同组成部分在其价值增殖过程中的职能差异性，我们不能简单地将社会生产中对劳动者的剥削现象归咎于资本本身。一方面，资本本质是社会经济关系的具象化体现，与去等价化一体两面的不仅是货物贸易的价值量扩张，更是社会总体生产力的不断增长。资本的预先投入为技术迭代创造了必要条件，其过程中的成本预支付与其风险不可分割。另一方面，不变资本和可变资本的职能差别也为持有者们提供了压榨的温床。资本加速了劳动者的异化，他们在愈发精密而复杂的社会生产中被牢牢嵌固，成为工业“齿轮”中无法挣脱的一环。较于原料与工具成本，工人们在经济活动中、在某种意义上被抹去了作为一个生活着的人具有的普遍属性，取而代之的是技能水平、体力、智力等依附于生产力的要素。剩余价值诱导着资本家们以竭尽剩余劳动的方式实现价值的最大化，作为被压迫着的前者显然对此无能为力，因为他们的生活资料早已经被归结为后者持有成本的一部分了。 总而言之，资本天然是价值增殖在商品流通中的映射。自它诞生的第一天起，它便与金钱、欲望密不可分。它萌发于广泛的货币载体的贸易进程中，在社会生产和消费的闭环中锚定于劳动者这一特殊的角色。尽管资本的诞生与商品经济、社会生产力的发展无不关系，但显然无法将其作为后者发展进步的必然产物和标志。从早期血淋淋的原始积累到人的劳动异化，资本只是助推着社会统治形式的变迁。它以一种更为高效而精妙的方式实现了少数统治者——在这个时代它们被冠以资本家的称号——对广大劳动工人的深层剥削。它以财富的障叶扩充了社会生产的收益群体，同时却也在事实上不断拉大阶级差异。一言概之，它是价值增殖的兴奋剂，同时也将自身价值消解了旧社会劳动的原始意义，在蛋糕难以持续做大的当下，它愈发暴露出如同封建时代般人吃人的本质。

八十年代多党合作制度的探索与改革历程1 作者 吴伟。原为中共中央政治体制改革研究室研究人员。中央统战部党派局原处长王彦君为本文写作提供了许多资料，作者谨致谢意。 如何改革和完善“中国共产党领导的多党合作制度”，是20世纪80年代后期政治体制改革中一项重要课题。1989年年初，根据邓小平“多党合作要拿出方案”的指示，当时的中央组织专门的研讨小组，进行了长达一年的研讨和方案制定工作。笔者根据所掌握的资料，对这一过程记述如下。

“多党合作”是80年代政治改革中最为敏感的一个问题现行的中国政党制度，叫作“中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度”。这项制度发源于上个世纪三四十年代，以抗日和反对国民党一党专政为目标而结成的由中共领导的“统一战线”。随着中共建政和执政地位的确立，这个“统一战线”逐渐演变成为“有中国特色”的政党制度。 在1949年和1950年建政初期（政务院时期），中共实行的是新民主主义的建国方针，在处理与各民主党派的关系上，延续了1949年中国人民政治协商会议制定的《共同纲领》中“多党合作”的政治主张，组成了中国共产党领导下的联合政府。中央政府首长和政务院各部门的行政首长，除由中共党员担任外，各党派民主人士和无党派民主人士也占据了近半的比重。但是，为了保证中共对政府的“绝对领导”，中央政府成立后一个月，1949年11月9日，中共中央又发出了《关于在中央人民政府内组织中国共产党党委会的决定》和《关于在中央人民政府内建立中国共产党党组的决定》。此后，中央和地方各级政府机关迅速而普遍地建立了党组或党委，对政府各部门实行“党的统一领导”，党的领导得到迅速“加强”。而在各级政府中担任职务的“民主人士”的职权则开始被逐渐削弱。 1954年9月，全国人民代表大会第一次会议召开，会议通过《中华人民共和国宪法》，《共同纲领》的基本法地位被取代。副总理以上职务全部由中共党员包揽，各部级机构行政首长中的民主党派和无党派人士也所剩无几；原来在政务院中担任领导职务的多数民主党派成员和无党派人士被安排到全国人大和政协。 1956年，毛泽东提出了与民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，他在阐述这一方针时说：“究竟是一个党好，还是几个党好？现在看来，恐怕是几个党好。不但过去如此，而且将来也可以如此，就是长期共存，互相监督。”（《论十大关系》，《毛泽东文集》第七卷，第34页）他还说：“所谓互相监督，当然不是单方面的，共产党可以监督民主党派，民主党派也可以监督共产党。为什么要让民主党派监督共产党？这是因为一个党同一个人一样，耳边很需要听到不同的声音。” 但是，毛泽东很快就放弃了这个主张。此后的几年里，中共相继发动了1957年的“反右”运动等若干场政治运动，大量的“民主党派”成员被打成“右派分子”，成了“人民的敌人”，多党合作由此受到严重破坏,“互相监督”开始变成共产党单方面对民主党派的监督。各级行政首长均由清一色的中共党员担任。到了文化大革命的十年，“多党”名存，“合作”实亡。 直至1976年粉碎“四人帮”和后来中共进行了“拨乱反正”之后，“中国共产党领导下的多党合作制度”才得以恢复。1982年9月，中共十二大根据总书记胡耀邦的意见，把“肝胆相照、荣辱与共”同“长期共存、互相监督”并提，作为中共与民主党派合作的基本方针，但多党合作在此时并没有形成完整的规范。 1986年，邓小平根据当时形势发展的客观要求，提出在深入进行经济体制改革的同时，同步进行政治体制改革的意见。10月，邓小平指定时任中央政治局常委、国务院总理的赵紫阳设立和主持中央政治体制改革研讨小组，进行政治体制改革方案的研讨和制定工作。在此后的研讨工作中，大量涉及了多党合作制度的改革问题。 1986年12月17日下午，中央统战部部长阎明复带领统战部的研究室主任、研究所所长、党派局局长，与中央政改办的有关人员开了一个以多党合作与政治协商为内容的“沟通会”，笔者参加了这次会议。 会上，阎明复首先提出一个重要问题。他说，从一国两制的前景看，香港回归后，将有代表参加人大；如果台湾也统一了，国民党也要参加政权机构。这样，在我们的政权中，除了共产党和八个民主党派以外，将会出现一个名副其实的反对党。将来人大、政协的政治环境会发生一个重大变化，这就是有反对党出现。1946年的国民参政会，我党是少数，一部分友党支持我们。将来，我党是多数，八个民主党派还会不会支持我们，是否会被国民党争取？这个问题十分重要。所以，从现在起就要考虑民主党派在国家政治生活中的作用，包括其自身建设都需要研究。 阎明复说，现在民主党派没有党纲。在人大中民主党派所占的比例、要不要成立党团都要研究。现在党派是代表地方、个人参加会议，将来要代表本党派。我们现在是党禁，只承认八个党派，反对组新党，对这个问题也要研究。应该考虑制定政党法来进行规范。我国的民主党派是先天不足，没有党纲，更像政治团体。后天又失调，由我们党包办代替。耀邦同志曾经提出，一定要想办法解决民主党派的经济独立问题。目前我们正在搞这方面的试点。 阎明复讲的另外一个问题是政治体制改革中怎么进一步搞好党派工作。他说，从我们的角度看，统战工作主要就是八个民主党派的问题。政治体制改革，就是要在我党能承受的范围内，加强民主党派的参政、议政、监督三方面的工作。参政的形式，是通过各级人大、各级政府。我们现在省一级还可以，在四五个省市有民主党派的副省长。但是他们不是作为党派代表参政的，而是作为非党人大代表参政的。从议政角度说，现在通过人大、政协进行，情况还可以。监督方面，国务院最近成立监察部，我们准备建议安排一两名民主党派人员担任副部长，以提高民主形象，也有利于行政监督机制的完善。我们现在的监督是自我监督，如果能充分利用起现在的体系，如政协的各个工作委员会，人大的各个委员会，监察部等形式，就可以很好地发挥民主党派的作用。 中央政改研究室主任鲍彤在后来听取中央政改办与会人员的汇报时表示，政治体制改革要研究允许不允许民主党派有自己的党纲。民主党派在人大和常委会中是否可以设立党团，也要进行研究，拿出个意见。统战部可否考虑，就哪几个必须进行改革的问题自行向中央提出报告。从他们那个角度提出，可能会更顺一些。 12月24日下午，中央统战部和中央政改办联合召开了一次民主党派和无党派人士座谈会。邀请了民盟中央副主席钱伟长、民盟中央执行局副主任罗涵先、民盟中央常委千家驹、民革中央副主席贾亦斌、民建中央委员吴大琨、农工民主党中央执行局副主任章师明、九三学社中央执行委员赵伟之、九三学社中央候补执行委员金开诚、无党派人士程思远等到会，听他们谈了对政治体制改革的想法，和对多党合作问题的改革思路。在发言中，几乎每个民主党派人士都涉及了一个要求，这就是，民主党派要成为真正的政党，要有自己的党纲，有自己的言论机构（指媒体）。 此后，中央政改办专门设立了“社会主义民主专题研讨小组”，多党合作成为其中的一项重要研究内容，该小组还就此提出了一个专题研讨报告。1987年10月召开的中共十三大上，当选为中共中央总书记的赵紫阳在报告中专门提出了要“完善共产党领导下的多党合作和协商制度，进一步发挥民主党派和无党派爱国人士在国家政治生活中的作用”的问题。 十三大后，为了改革和完善“中国共产党领导的多党合作制度”，主要做了以下工作：一是根据赵紫阳的提议，将“共产党领导下的多党合作制度”中的“下”字拿掉，改为“共产党领导的多党合作制度”，以表达共产党与其他参政各党派“平等合作”之意。赵紫阳认为，去掉了一“下”字，表面看差别不太大，但“领导是个政治问题，领导下就是一个组织问题”（《改革历程》第278页）。二是针对各民主党派作为政党，但普遍没有政纲的情况，提出支持各民主党派在社会主义总目标下和宪法的范围内，制定各自独立的政治纲领。三是加强在政府中的多党合作，吸收了若干民主党派成员到中央和省级政府部门担任领导职务。四是健全和完善执政党向各民主党派、无党派人士进行通报协商的制度。协商的主要内容包括对中共中央做出的重大决策事先征求各党派意见，重大事件的通报，准备提交政协协商的问题，等。

对于中国政党制度的思考十三大提出的《政治体制改革总体设想》和其后实施的过程中，改革和完善多党合作制度方面的工作力度不够，具体措施仍然没有跳出以往处理共产党与民主党派关系方式的老路。这是为什么？ 在现代国家，政党制度是国家政治制度的基础之一。在中国，只有“中国共产党的领导”才是国家政治制度的基础，而“多党合作和政治协商”是“党的领导”的一种体现。从形式上看，中国除中共以外，还有八个“民主党派”存在，但由于历史的原因，这八个政党却没有自己的政纲和执政目标。从这一角度说，中国离现代国家还有相当的距离。能否形成一个让各种政治力量都能平等地参与国家政治生活的政党制度，是中国实现向政治民主化、现代化的社会转型中最基本的一个问题。 如何进行多党合作制度的改革，涉及邓小平提出的“四项基本原则”最根本的一条：坚持党的领导。按照当时的说法，这次政治体制改革，是由共产党发动和主持的，是“社会主义制度的自我完善”。而“坚持共产党的领导”，则是邓小平为政治体制改革设定的一条红线，是不能碰的。碰了它，不但改革搞不成，而且会被扣上“资产阶级自由化”的帽子。 十三大后，赵紫阳主持的中共中央曾经专门研究过民主党派在人大中开展党派活动的问题。1988年春节后，正在筹备召开七届全国人大、政协第一次会议。中央书记处会议研究了在全国人大当中如何设置党组的问题。赵紫阳的意见是，在人大代表和人大常委中，保留中共党员组成的党组，党组书记是万里；其他各民主党派也应该允许分别成立自己的党组。书记处同意了这个意见。对此，赵紫阳后来回忆说：“这件事不知怎么传到邓那里，他那里传话给我的秘书李勇说，邓讲发挥民主党派的参政作用，只是讲讲而已，怎么能当真？绝不能在人大中间搞党派政治，邓是反对的。”（《改革历程》第279页）这样，书记处的决定被否决，在七届人大代表和常委中，仍然只有共产党可以设立党组，而其他党派不能设立党组。这种情况一直延续至今。 但是，民主党派党组不能搞，并不等于这场改革的主持者赵紫阳对这个问题没有认识，没有过思考。1988年在中央北戴河办公期间的7月16日，赵紫阳找温家宝（中办主任）、鲍彤、张岳琦（中办副主任，赵紫阳秘书）、龚育之（中央宣传部副部长）等人，谈思想政治工作改造和社会主义初级阶段研究问题。当龚育之说到文化多元化，有人讲是资产阶级的东西时，赵紫阳说，过去反右时把“双百方针”当作策略，百家争鸣，引蛇出洞。问题是只有马克思主义一家，战斗力太差，别的东西一出来，你就要靠行政手段去压了。龚育之问，“双百方针”的基础是什么？过去说是阶级分析，归根到底是两家（指所谓的“无产阶级”和“资产阶级”）。是不是归根到底还是要从认识论上，归结到有不同的利益集团问题上？对这个问题，赵紫阳表示赞同，并说，民主党派作用可以研究，是否起一点反对党的作用，如果让它亦步亦趋地跟着共产党，那要共产党一个党就行了，要这么多行政团体干什么，是否在某种程度、某种意义上要起点反对党的作用？如果真的搞反对党，那么拆台行不行？是成立反对党还是发挥群众团体的作用？ 这段话表明了赵紫阳对中国的政党制度曾经有过的思考。但是在当时条件下，他没有，也不可能进一步提出这个问题，没有，也不可能从根本上改变这个“共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商”制度的框架。赵紫阳很清楚，这次政治体制改革的目标是有限的，在政党制度方面，只能是在大框架不变的前提下修修补补。所以，十三大后他一直在考虑，怎么样才能更好地发挥民主党派对执政党即共产党的监督作用。

邓小平提出：多党合作要拿出方案1988年9月中共十三届三中全会之后，党内的一些人利用治理整顿之机，开始大开经济改革的倒车；政治体制改革由于复杂的政治原因也进退维谷，停滞不前；党内腐败之风愈演愈烈，以权谋私、权钱交易逐渐盛行；党内高层的政治斗争日趋激烈而又缺乏透明，海外港台各种流言四起，各种小道消息出口转内销，引发国内人心不稳。在此情况下，知识界一些人士认为，经济改革陷入困境的原因是政治改革滞后，要求加快政治体制改革的步伐。因此，社会上的民主化思潮空前活跃起来。民主党派中的许多人也在此时提出了改革多党合作制度，争取更多参政机会的政治要求。 1988年年底，中央统战部的内部刊物《零讯》第136、138、139期，连续刊登了几位民主党派人士对于改革多党合作制度的意见。赵紫阳看到以后，选择其中标题为《北京市部分民主党派成员和无党派人士对“多党合作”问题的看法和意见》的第136期，批送给了邓小平,请他“便中一阅”。1989年1月2日，邓小平在这份材料上批示：“可组织一个专门小组（成员要有民主党派的），专门拟定民主党派成员参政和履行监督职责的方案，并在一年内完成，明年开始实行。”（《邓小平年谱（下）》第1262页）赵紫阳遂于1月3日即做出批示：“小平同志批示印发常委同志。请明复同志负责总抓，组织一个专门小组（政改办参加）研究提出方案。”赵在这里所说的“政改办”是指十三大后设立，由鲍彤担任主任的中央政治体制改革研究室。 1月7日，鲍彤在中央政改研究室的全体研究人员会议上向大家传达了邓和赵的上述批示，和赵紫阳的有关意见。赵紫阳说，这是今年的一件大事，总要搞出一点成果出来，不能不了了之。这个问题和当前社会思潮有关。今年是五四的七十周年，有人提出推进民主政治问题，多党合作制，是个很好的题目。和廉政一样，对于政治体制改革的各方面工作，都会有推动。 鲍彤说，阎明复（时任中央书记处书记，中央统战部部长）同志准备召集各民主党派领导座谈，我们研究室的陈群林、陈小鲁负责，组织研讨专题。社会改革局要全力以赴，这是我们室今年的主要工作之一。 鲍彤也谈了他对这个问题的看法。他说，十三大上提到，要坚持共产党与民主党派“长期共存、互相监督、肝胆相照、荣辱与共”的方针，进一步发挥民主党派和无党派爱国人士在国家政治生活中作用的问题。现在民主党派这方面的要求很强烈，社会上的议论更多，甚至和议会政治、反对党联系到一起。如果我们不认真地研究这个问题，提出共产党的主张和措施，民主党派的合理要求得不到满足，那么不正确的观点，就会扩大市场。对此中央准备研究一下，到底采取什么样的方针，不是改变基本格局，而是使这个格局更加充实，有内容有形式，搞得更好一点。搞好了，对于发展民主政治有好处，也有利于缩小不正确观点的市场。 为了贯彻邓小平和赵紫阳的批示，1月初，阎明复主持召开了各民主党派负责人座谈会和党内“吹风会”，传达了邓小平和赵紫阳批示的精神，并在请示赵紫阳后，决定：第一，成立多党合作研讨小组，由各民主党派、工商联、全国人大、全国政协、国务院、中央统战部、中央政治体制改革研究室负责人参加，请赵紫阳任组长，阎明复任第一副组长，八个民主党派中央主席任副组长。第二，成立研讨小组办公室负责具体工作和起草文件，由中央统战部副部长宋堃负责（后改由部长阎明复亲自负责，常务副部长李定参加），党派局副局长孙楠、处长王彦君及工作人员詹清等三人常驻办公室负责日常工作，统战部党派局、研究室其他人配合。办公室成员还有中央政治体制改革研究室秘书长陈群林、社会改革局局长陈小鲁，中央政改研究室社会局其他人员也参与工作。全国政协也派出了处长米鹤都等参加办公室的工作。第三，中共党内成立一个工作协调小组，由中组部、中宣部、国务院、中央政改研究室、中办调研室、中央统战部、全国人大党组、全国政协党组等派人参加，通过党内进行协调。除了中共之外，各民主党派内部也都组织了专门的研讨班子，开展了自己的研究工作。 1989年1月15日上午，中央政改研究室全室研究人员开会，研究下一步的工作。陈小鲁介绍了中央统战部组织的多党合作研究情况。他说，中央统战部对这个工作比较积极，提出了许多想法。比如，是否可以设立多个国家副主席，由若干民主党派民主人士担任？今年人大会议以后，可否安排二十到三十个国务院部委的副职？对此，中央组织部回复说，因为年龄等原因，只能考虑安排几个人。全国人大提出，做这样的安排，是否考虑要修宪？ 2月16日下午，利用全国廉政制度建设座谈会开会的间隙，中央政治体制改革研究室召开了各省市负责政治体制改革部门的负责人会议。在这个会上，鲍彤通报了中央正在进行多党合作研讨的情况。他说，最近党中央和民主党派在研究如何坚持、完善、充实、发展中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度问题。中央准备用一年的时间搞方案，和民主党派取得一致意见以后再实施。许多问题需要中央和民主党派商量。要在大方面等中央的精神。中央组织了一个小组，民主党派要求紫阳参加，紫阳也参加了，还担任小组组长。 2月21日下午，在中央政改研究室研究人员全体会议上，陈小鲁再次通报了由中央统战部负责组织的多党合作研讨进展情况。他说，多党合作问题的研讨小组已经成立，叫作“完善共产党领导的多党合作研讨小组”，下设了一个办公室。研究的题目是多党合作的理论、方式和立法问题。提出的具体措施有很多，比如由民主党派成员担任政府、高检、高法两院的职务问题，人大、政协如何加强党派活动问题，国务院如何加强同党派的联系，党派办报，实体编制、财政等等。这项工作，我们室准备全力以赴。鲍彤在这次会议结束时特别强调，这是政治体制改革的一项极其重要的工作。我室的社会改革局下步工作的重点就是多党合作问题，石肖岩（综合局原副局长）调过去，加强力量。 据直接参加统战部多党合作研讨的陈小鲁的几次通报，在多党合作的研讨中，各方面提出的主要是这样一些问题： 第一，各民主党派在现阶段应该如何定位，它的社会基础、政治地位和作用是什么，是在野党、参政党还是执政党？ 第二，共产党同民主党派的关系应该如何确定？一些民主党派人士要求突破过去的传统框框，重新定位。 第三，民主党派同国家政权各机关的关系，有民主党派提出应该允许民主党派在人大、政协设立党团，开展有组织的活动。民盟已经决定，单独以民盟的名义，在今年人大上提出议案，并准备做大会发言。 第四，在人大、政协中应该开展党派活动。 第五，增加民主党派成员参加政府工作的人数，扩大参与的范围，并且应通过制定相关的法律法规和制度加以保证。 第六，民主党派对执政党、对政府的监督作用怎么体现，通过什么渠道，如何发挥。 第七，多党合作、互相监督要实现法律化。一是要修改宪法，把“长期共存、互相监督”通过宪法的形式固定下来；二是搞结社法、政党法；三是搞一个共产党和各民主党派多边宣言，通过这种形式，把多党合作的主要内容制度化。据陈小鲁说，阎明复提出搞一个多党合作的“大宪章”，阎认为，要考虑到港澳台将来回归的情况，这个“大宪章”，要让港澳台、大陆的民主党派都能接受。 第八，民主党派应该有自己的宣传阵地，应该允许其自行办报。 第九，民主党派的自身建设问题。特别是要允许民主党派在全社会发展党员，不应该受到仅能在某个领域发展的限制。 第十，增加各民主党派机构的人员编制和经费开支问题。这其中的经费开支问题，极其敏感而又牵涉广泛。中共建政之后，不但由国家财政包揽了中共的全部开支，而且也包揽了各民主党派、社会团体的全部费用，这与政党政治的原则是完全背离的。在政治体制改革研讨中，曾经提到中共党费自理的问题，但根本不可能实施。那么民主党派的增加经费、扩大编制应该如何和中共平衡处理，也是个难题。 从研讨中涉及的上述问题中可以看出，这次研讨也遵循了两年前中央政治体制改革研讨小组确定的原则，不设框框，不打棍子。在当时宽松的政治环境和政治体制改革的大背景下，参加这次研讨的中央统战部和民主党派各方提出的意见，有很多确实打破了过去的框框，如果能得到确立，并形成法律和规范的话，有可能为未来在中国实行现代政党政治奠定一个初步的基础。 当年曾经参加过这个研讨小组办公室工作的中央统战部党派局原处长石光树，后来曾经回忆说，在那场风波之前，研究小组和办公室的工作，“主要是研讨、设计文件框架。召开了各种层次、各个方面的座谈会十多次，各民主党派自己也研讨，然后把问题集中报办公室。办公室一共编辑十几期简报，分报领导小组成员。当时思想非常活跃，讨论十分热烈，研讨的问题也十分开放，涉及到多党合作的重大原则、民主党派的地位和作用，等等。”（《石光树研究文集》第215页） 在“完善共产党领导的多党合作制度”研讨工作顺利进行的同时，以宋平为部长的中共中央组织部也有了行动，开始为将来改进多党合作后，有更多的民主党派和无党派人士进入中央政府和其他国家机构担任负责人做准备。据时任中组部青年干部局处长的崔武年回忆，1989年3月前后，考虑到民主党派人士将来参政的需要，中组部领导要求该部的青年干部局扩大人员编制，增设一个“五处”，专门负责民主党派干部及民族干部、妇女干部的选拔工作。青干局副局长任小斌、处长崔武年等人为此拟定了组建方案，并向部务会做了正式汇报。 经过几个月的研讨和磨合，到1989年4月初，中共和各民主党派在研讨小组内部也已经就一些问题初步达成了一致意见。按照党内程序，下一步的工作，研讨小组内中共方面的党内协调小组应该形成一个报告，向中央常委和政治局汇报，听取中央对于整个多党合作大格局和具体做法的意见，中央统战部代拟的有关文件也在起草之中。当然，既然是政党党际之间的合作研讨，各民主党派参加研讨的人员也需要将研讨的情况向本党领导机构报告。但就在此时，1989年4月中旬，一场突如其来的学潮中止","date":"2018-12-20","objectID":"/zhengdang/:1:3","series":["报道与档案","中国共产党与社会主义"],"tags":["炎黄春秋","政治"],"title":"幕后视角：建国以来政党制度与统战工作的变迁","uri":"/zhengdang/#邓小平提出多党合作要拿出方案"},{"categories":["札录"],"content":" 多党合作的第一个规范性文件那场风波过去，政治形势稍稍稳定下来之后，因为这项多党合作的研讨是按照邓小平批示组织进行的，所以还需要进行下去。此时，原来主持这项工作的中共中央高层已是面目全非。赵紫阳因犯了“支持动乱，分裂党”的错误而被撤职；阎明复在中共十三届四中全会上被免去中央书记处书记职务，但因其在各民主党派中尚有相当大的影响，仍被暂时保留了中央统战部部长的头衔（1990年11月被免职）；鲍彤因“泄露党和国家机密、反革命宣传煽动罪”被逮捕，由他担任主任的中央政治体制改革研究室被明令撤销。中央统战部和中央其他部门一样，开始在内部进行“清查清理”和党员重新登记，从部长、副部长、各局局长到普通干部几乎人人受到波及。而各民主党派在政治高压下噤若寒蝉，不敢稍有异动。在这种政治气氛下继续进行多党合作的研讨，其结果也就可想而知了。 研究重新开始以后，多党合作研讨小组办公室起草的这个文件，被定名为《中共中央关于坚持和完善中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度的意见》，并又进行了几次重要的修改，先后由新任中央政治局常委李瑞环、中央总书记江泽民主持了两次座谈会，征求各民主党派和全国工商联负责人及无党派人士的“意见”。中共中央的“意见”顺利通过。 1989年12月30日，在邓小平对此问题做出批示一周年之后，这个《中共中央关于坚持和完善中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度的意见》，以中发〔1989〕14号文件发出，次年2月8日，《人民日报》全文公布。这个涉及“多党合作”的文件，终于以中共单方面的“意见”形式发布。这是中共建政以后，中国共产党领导的多党合作制度第一个带有规范性质的“指导性文件”，使“中国共产党领导的多党合作制度”在一定程度上规范化具体化了，也算是填补了一个“空白”。根据这个文件，民主党派被正式确认为“参政党”，至于在1989年上半年多党合作研讨前期曾经提到的“大宪章”、多党合作协议、结社法、政党法等等，则再也没有被提起。

政治的人生1多年来养成一种习惯，或者说不得不养成这样的习惯，就是在夜深人静的时候，静静地思考一天来的经历。白天，大部分时间均在异常的忙乱中度过，没有工夫思考。有工夫思考的时候，大多也用于作严肃而枯燥的学术思维，专业得厉害。而对于人生，却没有时间去思考。夜色下来，一切归于宁静，望着窗外闪烁的路灯，可以静静地思考自己和世界，思考在自己的行政工作和学术研究中排不上号的事情。从中找出有意义的东西，做一点小小的思想享受。 这种思考，对人是有益的。一个人做多了自己的职业活动，如果不调整，就会变得单一，思想也慢慢定向，没有开放式的思维方式。所以要在紧张的大脑和肢体活动之余，发现思维的新空间。 生活在这个世界上的人：有的是弱者；有的是强者；有的要别人来设定目标，有的给别人设定目标；有的需要感情支持生活，有的需要意志支持生活。我大概在每一对概念中都会选择做后一种人。 邓小平是比较务实的国际战略家，而毛泽东则是比较哲学化的国际战略家，有浓郁的诗人气质，对很多问题大而化之，有很大的气魄，意识形态色彩比较浓厚。而邓小平较讲究对中国自身发展有利的战略选择，基本转变是：认为战争可避免，因而可集中精力发展国民经济；不以意识形态在国际上划线，如过去以反苏划线，判断国际局势和决定国际战略要以国家利益为最高的原则：同时，中国要发展，必须全方位参与国际社会，这是历史总结。 发展报告写到现在，方知道我们对对策报告和社会现实问题并无深入研究，平常并不关心社会之发展，这是社会科学最大的虚弱。 人生不能总是一些莫明其妙的东西，社会也不完全是一些玩世不恭的人。一切是那样自然，很感人。虽然是不超常的路子，但却是普通人最需要的路子。这就是生活。这就是生活中需要的生命的光明和辉煌。 生活中有很多矛盾，不是来自恨，而是来自爱。有时候来自爱的矛盾虽不如来自恨的矛盾厉害，可怜的是对来自爱的矛盾大部分人没有办法，只好在无穷的矛盾中消磨人性。人们往往不知道爱也会带来恨，这是很多的悲剧之所以发生的根本原因。 人往往会有一种悲凉的感觉，越是热闹越是如此。从中感觉到自己生命的存在，感觉到世界是多么强大的外在力量，是可以不依人的感觉和情绪而存在的力量，是可以不依人的理性和理想而存在的力量。在平平淡淡的生活中，人们往往忘记了自己，觉得自己融入了社会和世界。但是，当世界沸腾起来时，才发现自己孤独安静的存在。 高明的人站在矛盾之上，不高明的人站在矛盾的一边。 在中国社会中，人们一直强调从人的内心世界来协调人们之间的关系，而不是从外部世界。所有的秩序，政治的也好，经济的也好，社会的也好，最终是一种精神上的秩序。在一种精神上的秩序没有形成之前，任何外在的秩序均不牢固。 问题不在于用什么样的内容来构筑秩序，而在于需要秩序本身。内容总是要随着历史的发展而发展的。 实质上，尼采更多的是想挥发人的本性和人的欲望，他认为现代文明约束了人的生命本能，所以要有“超人”。尼采自己就认为自己是“ 超人”，只是最后大概狂想太多，得了精神分裂症。 这部电影的风格比较典型地反映了法国文化，是纯粹法国风格的电影。它反映了法国电影中的一种“介入”的意识，也就是萨特的存在主义所强调的生命的意义。政治色彩很浓。对法国社会传统和官僚的机制作了批判。问题是这样的情况在很多社会中均存在，这是人类社会的一个通例吗？ 现在好像外国人来得太多了，要为一次讲座找到一些听众十分不容易。也可能是不少人对知识无兴趣，或者是外国人不能讲到中国人能理解的程度。但是，我发现所有的外国教授，除了少数，演讲总是不行，没有内容和逻辑，太浅。 参观了现代化的车间之后，总有一种想法，就是一个社会的政治体制和行政体制能否最后建立得像一个现代化的技术系统那样，完全在电脑的控制之下，非常有秩序和程序，能够有效地运转和产出。大概在社会系统中要实现这一点是困难的，因为社会的因素变异性很大，人文因素的变化更大，很难根据确定的程序来管理，而要有更多应变能力。但是，总觉得是可以努力的 孟子说，君子有三乐，一就是得天下英才而教之，此乃最大的快乐。生活在今天的人，常常说前人无能，把中国搞成这样，我们希望以后的中国人不会说今天的中国人无能，把中国搞成这样。这是我最大的愿望。 两位报考博士生的学生来找，问考事项。我说，博士考试已经不是教科书式的了，要依靠学生平常积累，临时准备不行。问题是在日常的学习中积累了多少知识，有多宽的知识面。研究生，特别是博士研究生要培养创造性，而不是对死的知识的记忆。不然就不可能培养出优秀学生。这是一个方向。第二就是注意逻辑分析的能力，要有较强的理性的推理能力，对事物要有足够的敏感性，要能够在一般的知识中发现可以创造的点。三是要有一个比较健全的人格，没有健全的人格是培养不出真正杰出的学生的，杰出不仅对个人而言，也是对社会和学术精神而言的。这是我们今后培养学生要注意的战略方向。 权力的运用是中国政治的核心部分，不能有效地运用权力，就不可能有稳定和统一的江山。 意识形态对中国的稳定也重要，中国的制度力量历来就不强大，所以要依靠一种意识形态和道德因素来管理，这就是儒家在社会管理中的地位一直能够保持的基本原因。 官员的腐败历来是王朝衰落的基本原因，中国社会的历史发展证明了这一点。 《停滞的帝国》是一种逻辑：帝国的存在往往以维护既有秩序和体制为基础，逻辑上帝国要求一种停滞的机制，不然帝国庞大的机制就会剥落，会在变动中风化瓦解。从新巴比伦的尼布甲尼撒二世到乾隆皇帝均深谙此道。所以封闭并不是早晨起来心血来潮的选择，而是帝国体制的必然。著名学者艾森斯塔特在《帝国的政治体制》一书中提出：帝国统治者所首要目标是“建立和维系一元化和中央集权的政体，以及统治者对于该政体的绝对权力”。封闭社会是保持这种体制的方法，而且是不可逃脱的办法。任何开放机制，最终会影响到封建帝国本身的权力体制。 上课，讨论西蒙的《管理决策新科学》和《管理行为》，以及弗洛姆的《逃避自由》。弗洛姆的《逃避自由》是一本很有深度的书。我觉得中国陷入一种二律背反：他的理论是说在市场经济的发展过程中，在现代个人主义文化的弘扬过程中，个人获得了自由，但是却孤独了。这样个人就有可能逃避自由。而中国的情况是在东方文化中，逃避自由是来自于集体主义价值。于是，如果中国的市场经济进一步发展，最后导致个人的自由领域的扩大，但是最后可能不是一种更加多的民主，而是弗洛姆所说的“逃避自由”。那么中国社会的发展趋向是什么呢？ 中国历来就是人口过剩的一个国家，人是最多的，因而人也就不宝贵了。但是现在的经济发展，要求着更多的人才，科学技术的发展是一种不可抗拒的力量，没有人才，社会就不能快速地向前发展。没有人就没有一切。 最后还是正义战胜邪恶的故事。这是美国这类电影的必然结局。故事写得再黑、再残酷，丑恶的东西再多，最后胜利的总是所谓正义的方面。这也是社会发展必然的要求，没有一个社会的精英集团会鼓励社会往邪恶的方向走，因为这不符合社会的基本利益。作为统治的阶层，这里说的是广义的统治阶层，最后是要一个有秩序的社会的，有符合他们传统的正义标准的社会秩序。没有此，任何社会均不能存在。 在中国人的心里，多一点空间是能够比什么都能带来乐趣的东西。大概是中国的人太多了，而空间相对就显得少了。 无需再做任何设问。我想，如果一定要刨根究底的话，它可能发源于我对生活的一种体验。因为我发现，人们看待一个有道德的人，透出的目光是亲切，看待一个有权力的人，透出的目光是敬畏，只有看待一个有知识的人，目光中才盈溢着无限的尊重，并饱含着由衷的敬佩。我向往那份尊重和敬佩。再有，我很欣赏书页中那一片于喧闹、复杂和浮噪之中仍可守的宁静的小天地。 难题是现在的人都等不了这种“文化利息”，因为要等的时间往往超过人的生命期限。而当一种利益超过人的生命期限时，人还会追求吗？人还有动力 去追求吗？人大凡是一种追求眼前利益的动物，长远利益往往不是出自理性，而是出于偶然。如从地下发掘出来的文物，埋的人并不期待历史的“文化利息”，而是出于一种“现时”的利益。挖的人得到“文化利息”，也不是因为历史，而是因为现时。 感觉最深的是，生命又消耗了许多。对生命有这样明确的意识，大概是源于走向老年的危机感。在少年时代似乎没有任何生命的感觉，所有的一切均似流水般地度过，除了有一次游泳时差点淹没在水塘里，那时对生命没有任何害怕。现在对生命的意识日益地强烈，可能是人的不能逃脱的逻辑。 有时想，人的最大的害怕是来自生命意识的。没有生命意识就无所谓害怕。而有生命的存在，是人的害怕的最后的条件。同时，人的最大的快乐也是来自生命的，没有生命就没有快乐。而生命的存在，是人的快乐的最后的条件。所有生活在这个世界上的人主动地或者被动地要在这两项条件中找出平衡来，因而就有了人的不同的分野。快乐也好，害怕也好，生命总是要流失。要在生命流失的过程中，尽量地实现自己的理想和意志，完成人的选择，这将是有价值的生命。历史在一年一年的过往，生命在一天一天地减少。 对个人来说是这样，但是对整个人类来说，历史在一年一年地延长，生命在一天一天地增加。个人就是在整体的增加中减少，而整体就是在个体的减少中增加。我们理解自己和社会，离开了这种认识，将减少应该具有的快乐。 https://book.douban.com/subject/2125296/ ↩︎

2.最底层人民生活水平有了一定改善，免费送的空调让他们热天也有空调开，免费送的网络电视让他们也能丰富精神生活。此外，当初辍学早的同学现在有月薪过万的工作很正常。 3.扫黑除恶。之前的黑恶势力多猖獗，大家都有所耳闻吧。哪怕是在象牙塔里的学生，也肯定都听说过学校里的xxx认识社会上哪个大哥，然后在学校搞霸凌。现在再有人说社会我大哥，我们只会觉得他脑子有坑。 4.生态环境改善。之前啥样的大家心里都有逼数，不过这都是有经济代价的。 5.法治建设，有一定成果。早年上访被拘、暴力催收的事比现在多太多了。现在身边情况 大多数人都相信法律。打官司这个词越来越常见。 6.年轻人机会少了，但这个跟全球经济形势变化有关。 2013年末，中国战略核潜艇带弹战备值班，拥有了最可靠的二次核反击能力，获得了底线核安全。尽管中国60年代就有核武器了，但是底线核安全直到2013年才建立，在此之前一直裸奔； 2015年军改。撤军区改战区，裁军30万（主要集中在文职），综合军力进一步提升，和美军实力极速缩小，为国家外部安全环境提供了保障。而军改能进行的前提是反腐，扫清了军队中的改革障碍； 2016年顺利挺过南海危机，中国获得了近海安全，间接保障了能源安全、粮食安全和贸易航道。遏制住了美国对中国动武的念头。从那以后中美的交锋只能在经贸、金融、舆论认知、科技、情报乃至公共卫生领域展开； 2018年，军队彻底实现了，一律不得经商。是的你没看错，好多人都觉得这是江时代的事儿，但事实上直到18年才彻底实现，搜索关键词：全面停止军队有偿服务； 军队建设关乎生死存亡，其意义和潜在影响事实上比反腐扶贫大多了。 对于中国人而言，生存并不像呼吸一样天经地义，其实是很奢侈的。所以说对中国历任领导人的评价，都不能忽视军队领域的建设。 但是我不懂为什么98上的时政讨论几乎就没有谈到这些的，就连正面肯定老习，说的也不过是反腐，扶贫。可能真是好日子过够了吧 治安变好了（个人感觉） 官场风气有所改善（在政府部门的亲戚表示公务宴请变少了；老家一个书记骆国清被抓了） 自然环境变好了（之前在北京明显感觉空气质量变好了；老家的臭水沟有治理） 房价变高了（似乎比初中那会儿更难买房） 舆论环境变差了（一来文艺作品和自媒体的内容很受限，二来现在的网上发言都很极端、情绪化） 我们家原本住公租房，是那种很破旧的木制瓦房。租金一年几百，而且国家会发补贴（合计住这房还倒赚钱）。 这几年我们县推进棚改化，把我们那一片棚户区都拆了，会根据房子情况发补偿金。政府同时在离家一公里内的地方新建电梯房，让我们这些拆了房子的人租住，租金便宜而且可以长期住下去，不过需要等三年房子才能建好，这期间得自己找地方住。 现在再过大概一个月我家就能搬进新房了，终于能在家里享受空调了。 所以我个人感受家庭情况在国家政策下变好了。 反腐、扶贫工作做的挺不错，尤其是扶贫吧，过年回乡下老家感觉比以前好很多。 但是言论自由收紧了，无论是网络发言还是文艺创作。 ","date":"2017-02-20","objectID":"/18/:0:0","series":["社科","人物","⭐️5"],"tags":["王沪宁","政治"],"title":"新时代 -

工业时代初期的封建社会主义者先引用一段《共产党宣言》关于“封建社会主义”的文字。 “法国和英国的贵族，按照他们的历史地位所负的使命，就是写一些抨击现代资产阶级社会的作品。在法国的1830年七月革命和英国的改革运动中，他们再一次被可恨的暴发户打败了。从此就再谈不上严重的政治斗争了。他们还能进行的只是文字斗争。但是，即使在文字方面也不可能重弹复辟时期的老调了。为了激起同情，贵族们不得不装模做样，似乎他们已经不关心自身的利益，只是为了被剥削的工人阶级的利益才去写对资产阶级的控诉书。他们用来泄愤的手段是：唱唱诅咒他们的新统治者的歌，并向他叽叽咕咕地说一些或多或少凶险的预言。 这样就产生了封建的社会主义，半是挽歌，半是谤文；半是过去的回音，半是未来的恫吓；它有时也能用辛辣、俏皮而尖刻的评论刺中资产阶级的心，但是它由于完全不能理解现代历史的进程而总是令人感到可笑。 为了拉拢人民，贵族们把无产阶级的乞食袋当做旗帜来挥舞。但是，每当人民跟着他们走的时候，都发现他们的臀部带有旧的封建纹章，于是就哈哈大笑，一哄而散。他们责备资产阶级，与其说是因为它产生了无产阶级，不如说是因为它产生了革命的无产阶级……因此，在政治实践中，他们参与对工人阶级采取的一切暴力措施，在日常生活中，他们违背自己的那一套冠冕堂皇的言词，屈尊拾取金苹果，不顾信义、仁爱和名誉去做羊毛、甜菜和烧酒的买卖。 正如僧侣总是同封建主携手同行一样，僧侣的社会主义也总是同封建的社会主义携手同行的。 要给基督教禁欲主义涂上一层社会主义的色彩，是再容易不过了。基督教不是也激烈反对私有制，反对婚姻，反对国家吗？它不是提倡用行善和求乞、独身和禁欲、修道和礼拜来代替这一切吗？基督教的社会主义，只不过是僧侣用来使贵族的怨愤神圣化的圣水罢了。” 这是163年前的文字。在马克思写这段话的时候，包括英国在内，全世界没有一艘铁甲舰，世界海军的主力还是一大票和拿破仑战争时期相差无几的木头船。陆地上，骑兵挥着马刀冲锋还是最重要的突击方式。中国的GDP，无论是工业还是农业，都是世界第一。总之，那是一个遥远的不得了的时代，遥远到大部分事情都和我们这个时代不一样。但是这段对“封建社会主义”的描述。让我这个已经适应了21世纪的家伙格外亲切。 1848年的时候，第一次工业革命刚刚结束，资本主义和工业正式结合，在欧洲的西北角造成了一个前所未有的力量中心。别看农业社会的GDP还很高，但资本主义工业社会战斗力强大、增长迅速，正在不断地吞噬农业社会的人力、土地和财富。1840年，蒸汽船拖着英国的战列舰截断了大运河漕运，清朝政府投降。1855年，法国的铁甲舰轰平了俄国的要塞，俄国认栽，割地赔款。中国是人口最多的农业国家，俄国是军力最强的农业国家，这两个国家都被工业国的远征军打服了，工业社会在旧体制面前证明了自己无可争辩的霸权。 从长期来看，工业社会创造了更多的财富，但是从短期来看，大部分财富都被资本家拿走了，留给无产阶级的只有勉强糊口的工资。要是工人想不干——随便，被摧毁的农业社会随时提供无穷无尽的劳动力供给，所以工资咋也涨不上去，更不要说政府军拿到了工厂生产的武器，镇压能力比以前强得多。巴黎本来是个三天两头筑街垒的城市，自从法国完成工业化以后，市民的街垒从来没成功地挡住过政府军。1863年林肯征兵，让富人掏钱免役，直接用军队到穷人里抓壮丁，导致贫民暴动占领纽约，结果林肯直接派巡洋舰和炮兵轰击，三下五除二就平息了暴动。工人们左边有新劳动力竞争，右边对着政府军和警察的枪炮，唯一能做的就是认命干活。 当然了，资本家要保证能不断地从农业社会里抽取劳动力，就不能让工人的货币收入低于农民。从这个角度说，工业社会的平民并不比农业社会的平民更穷。但是，工人们从农村来到城市贫民区，放弃的不仅仅是当佃农那点收入，还有农村社会原来的组织结构。 在19世纪的时候，农业社会已经持续了好几千年，比几十岁的工业社会要成熟的多。贵族、官僚和教会在拿走农民大部分剩余财富，让农民仅能糊口的同时，知道在某些要紧的地方要施点小恩小惠，免得矛盾在最激烈的地方变成反抗。比如说，许多寺庙在占有大批地产的同时，也会赈济饥民、提供象征性地免费医药、设置义冢等等。类似的，中世纪西欧领主也要为失去劳动能力的农奴提供基本衣食，允许贫苦妇孺到收割过的土地上拾麦穗、放牧。再加上稳定的社区提供的宗教、家族文化，即便农民和工人拿到同样价值的收入，一般来说感觉是要比工人好一点的。 这样的农民，等到资本家圈了地，或是农村手工业被大工业摧毁，或者仅仅是自家土地被霸占之后进城，虽然也能卖力气换个糊口，但也因此丧失了农村的基本福利和精神安慰，甚至丧失了正常持家的能力。比如说，一个青年农民，本来在农村努力耕作，在长辈和邻居的影响下，把每年的少量盈余攒下来养老，或是应付翻盖房子这种大事。到了城市里，他面对的是完全陌生的生活环境，还没有形成一种能让他从长计议的文化环境。所以往往是年轻时生活尚过得去，老了就听天由命。老舍的《骆驼祥子》开头就描写了这样的生活环境： “北平的洋车夫有许多派：年轻力壮，腿脚灵利的，讲究赁漂亮的车，拉“整天儿”，爱什么时候出车与收车都有自由；拉出车来，在固定的“车口”或宅门一放，专等坐快车的主儿；弄好了，也许一下子弄个一块两块的；碰巧了，也许白耗一天，连“车份儿”也没着落，但也不在乎。这一派哥儿们的希望大概有两个：或是拉包车；或是自己买上辆车，有了自己的车，再去拉包月或散座就没大关系了，反正车是自己的。 比这一派岁数稍大的，或因身体的关系而跑得稍差点劲的，或因家庭的关系而不敢白耗一天的，大概就多数的拉八成新的车；人与车都有相当的漂亮，所以在要价儿的时候也还能保持住相当的尊严。这派的车夫，也许拉“整天”，也许拉“半天”。在后者的情形下，因为还有相当的精气神，所以无论冬天夏天总是“拉晚儿”②。夜间，当然比白天需要更多的留神与本事；钱自然也多挣一些。 年纪在四十以上，二十以下的，恐怕就不易在前两派里有个地位了。他们的车破，又不敢“拉晚儿”，所以只能早早的出车，希望能从清晨转到午后三四点钟，拉出“车份儿”和自己的嚼谷。他们的车破，跑得慢，所以得多走路，少要钱。到瓜市，果市，菜市，去拉货物，都是他们；钱少，可是无须快跑呢。 在这里，二十岁以下的——有的从十一二岁就干这行儿——很少能到二十岁以后改变成漂亮的车夫的，因为在幼年受了伤，很难健壮起来。他们也许拉一辈子洋车，而一辈子连拉车也没出过风头。那四十以上的人，有的是已拉了十年八年的车，筋肉的衰损使他们甘居人后，他们渐渐知道早晚是一个跟头会死在马路上。他们的拉车姿式，讲价时的随机应变，走路的抄近绕远，都足以使他们想起过去的光荣，而用鼻翅儿扇着那些后起之辈。可是这点光荣丝毫不能减少将来的黑暗，他们自己也因此在擦着汗的时节常常微叹。不过，以他们比较另一些四十上下岁的车夫，他们还似乎没有苦到了家。这一些是以前决没想到自己能与洋车发生关系，而到了生和死的界限已经不甚分明，才抄起车把来的。被撤差的巡警或校役，把本钱吃光的小贩，或是失业的工匠，到了卖无可卖，当无可当的时候，咬着牙，含着泪，上了这条到死亡之路。这些人，生命最鲜壮的时期已经卖掉，现在再把窝窝头变成的血汗滴在马路上。没有力气，没有经验，没有朋友，就是在同行的当中也得不到好气儿。他们拉最破的车，皮带不定一天泄多少次气；一边拉着人还得一边儿央求人家原谅，虽然十五个大铜子儿已经算是甜买卖。” 这样的生活，和没有被战乱波及的农民相比，的确是要悲剧一些。而这些工人的子女，由于自幼就缺乏传统社区的生活环境和父母照应，往往自幼健康就被童工制度损害，长大后生活的恶劣情况比父辈更甚。几代人恶性循环下来，城里的工人住宅区就和原来还过得去的农业村落形成了明显差距，但工人们已经丧失了退回农村的可能，只能一代代地沉淀在这种社区里，成为知识分子们眼中的地狱。 客观的说，农业社会的农村也不是什么天堂。无子的老汉经常是一个人默默地病死；养不活的孩子经常出生就被扔到开水桶里；为了佃到一块能糊口的土地，农民经常要把妻女送到地主家里去讨地主的欢心。解放前的少林寺和尚就公开地对自己的佃户宣布：“有好媳妇的种好地，没好媳妇的种赖地，没媳妇的别种地”。但是，这些苦难是分散在广大农村的，脚上不愿意沾泥巴的贵族知识分子一般看不到。而且农村的贫富差距再大，也大不过工业革命之后的城市。当时的地主，不管是几十亩还是几百亩的家产，只要土地还没有用“顷”来衡量，一般也做不到自家人四季吃细粮，小妾穿绸缎。而城市里，完全可能一边资本家新贵一掷万金，从几千里外请乐队开音乐会祝贺生日；另一边女工和童工每天工作16小时，婴儿躺在机器边的草堆上，哭的时候就用鸦片膏安抚一下。极端的奢华和相对而言极端的绝望放在一起，可以让任何不急着赚钱的知识分子为之动容。所以，在旧时代的知识分子看来，农村生活颇有一种田园诗一般的朦胧美感，可以拿来批判工业社会的苦难。 之所以知识分子批判工业社会。很重要的一个原因是他们根本不属于这个社会。工业社会的历史只有几十年，统治集团还没有足够的时间组成帮闲队伍，所以大部分知识分子还是沿袭了农业时代统治集团的思维。而农业时代的统治集团，比如封建贵族，比如乡下的大地主，儒家官僚，本来就是工业时代要清理的对象。一部分农业时代的精英比较识时务，主动把土地为主的资产换成工业资本，但大多数还转不过这个弯来，只能一面看着自己的财产相对缩水，一面抱怨世风日下、人心不古。所谓的“封建社会主义”就是这么产生的。这些人主张社会改良，要求提高工人待遇，抱怨资产阶级不会管理国家，管来管去造就了一个对社会不满的无产阶级。早晚有一天，这些无产阶级会造反，无差别地把旧贵族和新暴发户一起挂在路灯上。

中国工业化的路线分歧中国的工业化要比欧美晚的多，直到新中国建立，中国也是一个以农业为主的国家。工业资本主义在中国是个稀罕物。但中国的传统农业文明要比西方强大的多，指望复古救国的人相当不少。所以这一波复古思潮中国也没落下。康有为就写过儒家和社会主义结合的《大同书》，杨度可以劝进袁世凯，玩够了帝王术之后当共产党。甚至还有人不光写文章，还下手搞了实践。比如说那个著名的梁漱溟，年轻的时候搞革命，后来在国民政府司法部当秘书。忽而一日，他大彻大悟，发觉一切的问题来自西方的冲击： “（我）悟得了什么？并不曾悟得了多少新鲜的，只是扫除了怀疑的云翳 ，突出了坦达的自信：于一向所怀疑而未能遽然否认者，现在断然地否认他了！于一向之有所见而未敢遽然自信者，现在断然地相信了！否认了什么？否认了一切西洋的把戏，更不沾恋！相信了什么？相信了我们自有立国之道，更不虚怯！”。他宣布，在西方文化的冲击下，中国伦理本位丧失，固有的良好传统尽遭破坏，中国人变得“以自己为重，以伦理关系为轻，以权利为重，义务为轻。以个人为本位，社会为本位皆不成功，陷入东不成、西不就的状态中”。 他这一番思想的确说动了不少人，包括一些军阀。他最终在山东邹平开了一个乡村自治试验区，即山东乡村建设研究院。几年下来的确有些成效，在教育卫生和经济发展上比周边地区强了一截。不过，大部分赞颂他的文章都有意地回避了一个事实，即邹平县在搞实验期间是不向上级交税的，本级政府反而要靠上级补贴运行。政府的权威来自于军阀的支持，但又幸运地远离了军阀混战。在这种优越条件下，他要是还不能让试验区的老百姓过的比中国平均水平好一些，那就太笨了。 等到解放之后，梁漱溟坚持他的观点，即乡村自治，靠农民自己把经济搞起来，即全国都要像他的邹平县。共产党则粗暴地拒绝了他的建议，坚持认为只有在政府主导下优先发展工业，用化肥、电泵和水利设施改造农业才能给中国农村带来希望。在参考了历史之后，共产党政府认识到，在一个农业国搞工业，让农民和工人同收入，实际上是不能吸引最优秀的人加入工业建设的。所以必须适当提高工业人口的收入，才能从长远来看提高农业的实际产出。于是就有了梁漱溟和毛泽东著名的那次吵架。事后梁漱溟靠边站了，闲居到1988年。事实证明，几十年间中国粮食产量的提高，几乎全部的动力都是因为工业发展推动了农业技术变革。不知道梁漱溟是否认识到了这一点。总之，中国也没有给这批复古派在全国充分实践的机会，没有让他们演示一下怎么把中国搞砸。所以直到今天，还有不少搞人文的学术混子打出“儒家社会主义”的旗号，当新东西骗研究经费。 客观上说，不管是马克思那个时代封建社会主义的鼓吹者，还是中国的梁漱溟，甚至拉丁美洲一些支持人身依附制度的教士。我对他们还是抱有三分敬意的。最起码他们对资本主义主导的工业化作出了正确的批判。至于他们提出的解决方案，虽然很荒谬，但也大多数是出于真诚。因为他们在野蛮的资本主义与貌似温柔一点的旧秩序之外，实在想不出还有什么更好的选择。他们的失败不在于理论不精妙，也不在于旧秩序不能运行。如果没有工业革命，他们本来可以作一个很出色的封建社会知识分子，但在一个崭新的工业时代，他们所提倡的制度没法激发工业的活力，所以必然会被历史的车轮碾成碎片。他们和投湖的王国维一样，是旧制度的殉道者，算是一场还算严肃的悲喜剧的主演。所以我说这次历史逆流还算得上正剧。 新时代需要工业。但怎么搞工业，不同的人有不同的看法。旧中国的民族资本家觉得这个任务交给他们干最合适，政府只要保证农村不发生叛乱就好，当然他们干了几十年了，也没见得有什么好效果。而共产党干部认为中国必须由政府主导来搞工业，整个50年代都在批判软弱的民族资产阶级，以及感情上倾向于他们的一部分技术干部。到了60年代中期，很明显共产党的工业建设已经初步显现了成果，中国开出了足以自给的石油，在苏联援助下建起了体系完整的制造业，为工业升级服务的科研、教育也走上了正轨。但是，党的干部官僚化、特权化、权力封闭化，甚至世袭化的苗头也在出现。虽然远不能和今天相比，但的确是一个难以阻挡的趋势。 对此问题，当时主持中央工作的刘少奇的方案是四清，即清帐目、清仓库、清财物、清工分。发动干部去整资产阶级分子，从各处机关抽调干部去整基层干部。用刘少奇的原话说，是： “农村方面有一个问题，是陶铸同志提出的，说农村当前的主要矛盾是富裕农民阶层跟广大群众、贫下中农的矛盾，几个同志也这样讲，农村里面已经形成富裕阶层了，已经形成特权阶层了，是这样讲，还是这样讲，就是原来的地、富、反、坏跟蜕化变质的有严重错误的坏干部结合起来跟群众的矛盾?”_ 即刘少奇认为，问题出在地主富农等坏人身上，他们还拉了一批基层干部下水，这应该是斗争的主要对象。为了验证自己的看法，刘少奇的夫人王光美以钦差的身份下去抓典型，搞了一个“桃园经验”，即组织一个庞大的工作队，下去揪基层干部的问题。 毛泽东则激烈反对刘少奇的意见，毛认为民族资产阶级也好，农村的地主富农也好，被整了这么多年，早就没啥活力了。现在的问题是掌握工业化力量的干部自上而下的堕落，变成新的“走资产阶级道路的当权派”即走资派。不解决这个问题，中国早晚会在这批共产党人的领导下走向资本主义——当然不是民族资产阶级喜欢的那种殖民地盛行的自由资本主义，而是新型的国家资本主义。用毛泽东的话说： “地、富、反、坏是后台老板，‘四不清’干部是当权派。你只搞地、富，贫下中农还是通不过的，迫切的是干部，地、富、反、坏还没有当权，过去又斗争过他们，群众对他们不怎么样。农村的中心问题是这一批干部，主要是大队和生产队的干部，骑在他们头上，他们不好混，穷得要死。地、富、反、坏那些人已经搞臭过一次了。不是反封建吗？不是民主革命吗？不是分土地吗？至于这些当权派，从来没有搞臭过，他又是共产党，上面又听他的。不要管下层，只管五大领袖，这是共产党，是当权的人，不当权也是跟着跑的人。管你是挂名的共产党也算，过去是国民党的也算，过去是真共产党变了的也算，总而言之你是掌大权。就是要发动群众去整我们这个党，整那个支部，那个公社党委。中心问题是整党，不整党没希望……杜甫有一首诗，其中有这么四句：‘挽弓当挽强，用箭当用长。射人先射马，擒贼先擒王。’这几句通俗明了。就是搞那个大的，大的倒了，那些狐狸慢慢清嘛，群众知道嘛。群众就怕搞不了大的。” 最后，中央推出的解决方案还是刘少奇的四清方案，毛泽东掏出宪法来，要求以普通公民的身份反对。对于已经实践的四清经验，毛泽东的评论是： “集中了一万五千人，搞一个小县，二十八万人口，搞了几个月还搞不开。学习文件四十天，不进村。我看是搞了繁琐哲学。我不赞成这种学习。到农村去可以学嘛。二十几岁的大学生，光是学文件怎么学得进去？有成绩没有？那个文件，一天就读完了。第二天议，议一个星期就下去。到农村里去学嘛，向贫下中农去学嘛。你一个新城县，二十八万人口，下去一万五千人，还说人少了。哪里来这么多的人？哪里要这么多的人？我看是人多了。你只依靠工作队，为什么不去依靠那个县的二十几万人？越学越蠢！反人家的右倾，结果自己右倾。” 之所以在四清运动的问题上扯了这么久。我的意思是，毛泽东自己对这种以干部为主导，针对基层“坏分子”下手，兼顾整一下基层干部的运动方式极不感冒。认为党蜕变成特权集团，发展成资产阶级统治集团的主要问题在党的上层。必须发动群众来整党，而不是靠党的上层来净化整个社会。毛泽东的想法对不对并不是本文的重点，我不想过多论述。我只是说，不管是四清、文革、反资产阶级自由化、八荣八耻，还是唱红打黑。这些运动到底符不符合毛泽东思想，不能以是否捧着毛泽东的牌位为标准，是否喊着共产主义口号也无所谓，关键是要看运动的主导方向：是群众整党？还是党的高干教谕天下？ 这个选择决定了运动的性质。 四清之后不久就是文革。完全可以把文革视为对四清以及此前十七年共产党主导工业化路线的一个清算。毛泽东号召群众起来搞大民主，踢开党委闹革命，再从这种大民主的动荡中重组革命的政权。试图在西方那种财团资金+私营媒体的选举游戏和苏式集权政体之外，寻找一条适合工业化社会的新路。文革到底好不好，文革到底成功了没有，这都是很大的题目，但和本文无关，暂不讨论。我这里想要说的是文革初期的一个插曲，即高干子弟造反。 文革刚一发动，官僚们本能地，也是故意地把运动继续解释为整旧社会余孽，也就是那些民族资产阶级和地主富农子弟。以此来证明自己统治的合法性。由于此时的中国已经初步完成了工业化建设，即便没有那些出身不好的技术干部帮忙，干部也有信心控制社会甚至继续发展，所以这次他们打算整的格外狠。 文革一开始，运动从学校发起，刘少奇立刻向学校派了工作组，打算继续指导运动。刘少奇、邓小平等人的子女也都在学校里当钦差，带着支持者整那些出身不好，平时喜欢提意见的“资产阶级分子”。其他干部子弟见状也立刻出头，在赤裸裸的“血统论”支持下建立红卫兵组织。 “联动”（首都红卫兵联合行动委员会）就是其中最著名的一个。其他地方还有沈阳的“红后代”、武汉的“三字兵”、 西安 “红色恐怖队”等干部子弟的组织。统称老红卫兵。这些组织有父母撑腰，有运动助威，到处进行毫无意义的暴力破坏，打着毛泽东的旗号杀人放火。尤其是那些旧社会统治阶级子弟，现在虽然主要以技术干部面貌出现，但也客观上挡了新官僚的提升路，在这场袭击前尤其倒霉。短短几周内，全国有数千人死于他们的暴力。薄一波等高官的儿女，当年都是其中的骨干。 除了打人杀人，这批毛孩子能做的事情不多，只有大搞形式主义，以证明自己暴力的合法性，证明自己够“红”，进而证明自己继承父辈权力的合法性。现在流传下来文革期间的荒唐事，比如烧文物，比如红绿灯倒置，借抄家之名抢古董，大多来自这个短暂的时期。","date":"2016-11-06","objectID":"/left-history/:1:2","series":["观点与评论","中国共产党与社会主义"],"tags":["马前卒","时政"],"title":"建国以来左右思潮的历史演变与民族叙事的构建","uri":"/left-history/#中国工业化的路线分歧"},{"categories":["札录"],"content":" 左翼同民族主义的联姻明明是复古，偏说是进步；明明要维护特权集团，偏说是毛泽东思想。搞封建世袭，却振振有词的说“革命的孩子接革命的班”。发动自上而下的暴力活动，最后硬说是文化大革命。这和当年以改良和革命的名义，向农业时代倒退的行为颇为相似。不过，当年搞封建社会主义的精英们多少还带着为旧时代殉道的真诚，1966年满街横行的高干子弟们只是为了继承权力而撒蛮。在他们长辈的指教下，这些看似荒诞的行为，背后有着非常明确的目的性。正如泼妇在亲戚面前又哭又闹，时而寻死觅活，时而要和别人一决雌雄，时而倒地打滚，为的无非是分家时多拿几份财产。一旦财产到手，泼妇也就正常了。这次历史重演，应该算是红色贵族们一场耗资巨大的闹剧。 又过了几十年，20世纪90年代到了。92年以后的共产党终于摆脱了理想主义的束缚，堂堂正正地成为一个只为自己考虑的利益集团，打天下、坐天下，还要给子女传天下。但是，此时他们拿到的这份家产看起来却颇为不妙。 80年代的改革是狂欢，农民们不用再被公社动员起来大修水利，只要往分到手的小块土地上施加越来越普及的化肥就能增产。工人们不用再搞政治学习，子弟不用下乡，企业不技改也要给工人发奖金发福利。老官僚被打倒的一律平反，补发工资还允许子弟去官倒。唯有知识分子不高兴，科学的春天原来只持续到华主席下台。于是自由主义的精英思想逐步蔓延。 这种日子过了10多年，到了90年代中期终于过不下去了。国企设备老化，运行成本高昂，税负沉重，一个个倒闭，上千万的工人下岗，东北小姐开始在全国闻名。没了工业，地方政府只能向农业收税，养活扩张了数倍的官僚。正所谓一税轻，二税重，三税是个无底洞。结果不断地激起民变。90年代我父亲去一个山村，亲眼见过老汉在山头放哨，监视乡政府的工作队。矛盾激化的地方，烧个乡政府那是家常便饭。 国际上，苏联没了，美国步步紧逼，到后来直接掏出导弹轰了大使馆。国内那些不得志而亲美的知识分子还大肆宣扬美国是误炸，我们要体谅。台湾趁机要独立，大家一致回头看军队——军队20年没更新装备，倒是做了20年生意，人心涣散。唯一看起来有希望的消费品出口还因为东南亚金融危机和台海危机大受影响。中国所有的城市都有大批的失业人口在闲逛。老年人提前退休去养老，可是医疗产业化了，看不起病单位也不再报销；青年人唯一的希望在于读书，但教育也在市场化，工农子弟根本没法获得平等的起跑线。1998年我去上海读大学，那一年上海重点大学的平均学费是3400/年，比其他地区的学校大概高上1000多块。作为这1000多块钱的结果，我同班30多人，只有一个人来自农村——他的志愿表是老师代填的。 内外交困，底层平民开始回想当年毛泽东留下的革命口号，小资产阶级开始怀念历史上的汉唐雄风——当然他们只怀念汉唐王朝的荣耀，不会想到荣耀背后的百姓负担。于是民族主义和泛左翼的共运开始联姻，成为这个时代最大的反对派。俺也是在这个时期开始从自由主义转向共产主义的。 民族主义和泛左翼之所以能够以共同体的形式出现，一个重要的原掌舵的官僚集团信了自由主义的忽悠。按说这个官僚集团过去搞共产主义，现在搞国家资本主义，本来不该听什么市场原教旨主义的忽悠。但是呢，官僚集团缺乏创新能力，眼看苏联倒了，美国在冷战中大获全胜。本来就容易下意识地往西方的体制上靠。再加上这些年的知识分子都是听美国之音长大的，捏着几本萨缪尔森和哈耶克的扫盲读本，给官僚们画了一个美好而光荣的自由资本主义洋天堂，官僚集团自然就信了。于是能卖的国企都被卖光，外资得到了超国民待遇，一起起民变被解释为“改革阵痛”。甚至美国的步步进逼，在大使馆被轰掉之前也被解释为先进国家的提携。全盘的市场化之下，大连市委书记微笑着对记者表态：“在人脑子里，一提起国有资产，也首先想到国有企业，并往往把国资和国企等同起来。为了发展经济，过去很多城市都是一个路子，即争项目，找贷款，办工厂，通过兴办企业，出产品，上产值，拿利润，增税收，这样政府就有钱了……应该放手让企业家去做，市长首先应集中精力把城市本身的事情做好，把市民安顿好，把软硬环境搞好，城市才能走上良性发展之路……我的体会是：一靠良好的环境，二靠吸引外资。环境加外资，就能发生化合反应，城市就能增值。” 这种政府受到了民族主义和共产主义运动的一致抨击。那个时候网上的政治帖子，不是从底层的苦难说到政府丧权辱国，就是从军备不振扯到民生凋敝。总之阶级问题和民族问题是分不开的。政府被视为买办，军队被视为溃疡，毛泽东作为反对派的最大牌位，兼顾了列宁和俾斯麦的角色，既是平民的革命领袖，也是小资们眼中能振作国势的铁血元首。也正是在这个时候，文革被重新审视，从一个被唾骂了20年的疯狂时代重新成为值得思考甚至效仿的对象。面对振振有词的自由派知识分子，听着他们声称要为美国入侵带路，为教育、医疗产业化辩护的言论。不管是左翼共运还是右翼民族主义都恨的牙根痒痒。一边怀念文革，一面暗暗的琢磨：“三天不打，上房揭瓦”，看你能得意到什么时候。自我记事以来，那是政府声望的最低点。 那时互联网刚起来，政府还没有主动控制的意识。翻翻各个bbs，那时的老帖子里找不到一个现在意义上的“五毛党”，只见到泛左翼和民族主义联盟，与激进的自由主义吵架——吵架的双方都在政府的对立面。那时几乎每个省都有地域性的左翼网站，比如上海红旗、湖南红旗之类，左翼的声势非今天可比。像铁血网这样的低级民族主义网站也是从那个时候开始出现的。 不过，中国的运气不错。危机最严重的时刻也是转机到来的时刻。苏联解体之前，美国人的既定国策已经从工业立国转向金融立国，这样美国就能动员大半个世界的资源来和苏联一国死磕。等到冷战胜利，美国已经陷于发债印钱的金融毒品中不可自拔，甚至整个西方都在转移产业，印钱买东西的狂欢中迷失了帝国主义的本性。更何况中国信仰混乱，统治集团那么好忽悠，转移点工业过去有啥大不了的？不知不觉，按照购买力体现的实际汇率折算，中国变成了世界第一工业大国。虽然这个工业国的大部分红利都被西方用金融陷阱剥削走了，但形成的生产能力是实实在在的。 中国的另一个运气是拥有苏联这个老朋友。苏联在1991年挂掉，让中国减少了北方沉重的军事压力，还给中国卖了一大批白菜价的军事技术。不过，死掉的苏联最宝贵的援助是休克疗法。苏联所谓的500天向市场经济过渡，在原教旨市场经济学说的指导下，变成了一场寡头官僚们的抢劫盛宴。中国的官僚倒不是不羡慕这种抢劫，毕竟爹有娘有不如自己有。划到自己名下的才算好东西。但是，再仔细一看苏联，抢劫之后，制造业已经完全垮了，剩下的只有资源产业和军工产业。中国要是这个抢法，以中国的军工和人均资源水平来看，抢劫犯们手里剩不下什么东西，只有十亿饥饿的民众。俗话说贼不走空，抢劫犯再有作案的欲望，也不会干这种亏本买卖。再一看俄罗斯国势日衰的惨样，哪个大国的统治集团也不想过那种日子。所以，尽管官僚们迷茫无知，尽管自由派的学者鼓噪游说，中国终究没有拆散自己最核心的工业，同时保持着对西方产业转移的来者不拒。 这就催生了一个怪现象，一方面中国有完整的工业体系，另一方面这个工业体系缺乏资本和升级的技术——西方正好在拼命地把这些东西塞给中国，不要都不行，好像唯恐中国不强大一样。如此看来，当年那句著名的口号“帝国主义正在一天天烂下去” 是一个非常正确的判断。西方的国家资本主义在冷战中彻底沉溺于金融游戏这个毒品，瘾头越来越大，所以自欺欺人地认为中国早晚会和俄罗斯一样乖，假装看不到中国潜在的实力，为了眼前的利润和廉价消费品，眼睁睁看着中国变成世界第一工业国。中国自己也是半梦半醒，看着苏联的榜样，觉得的确不能自己拆自己的核心产业；但眼下还的确是那些外资和民企主导的加工业赚钱。犹豫不决之下，两边都得到了发展空间。这种态度更是让西方国家转移产业、开放市场玩的更放心。 所以，尽管中国自己发展思路不清，但熬过东南亚金融危机之后，客观上中国的经济和统治集团的自信心是已经到底了。2001年-2002年左右，中国已经触底反弹，就业、技术积累都明显开始好转，老企业那些缺医保的下岗工人该死的也死差不多了，不再给政府添麻烦。帝国主义的配合和苏联的自我牺牲精神给了中国一个神奇的机会。 谷底的时候，可以说是希望最大的时候，但也可以说是最危险的时候。美国毕竟还是有一批老谋深算的家伙，觉得中国变成第一工业国可能会导致不可控的后果。所以想趁这个谷底扼杀这种趋势。宁可少用点廉价消费品，也要打击一下中国。1999年大使馆被炸，2001年南海撞飞机，都是美国一步步紧逼，拉架势要动手的表现。那时的中国，第一批歼11（国产su27）服役才几个月，国产神盾舰还要两年才能下水，解放军的主力装甲部队以59坦克为主，导弹核潜艇还是80年代初下水的老货色。最要命的是军队涣散了20年，还没从开妓院、走私柴油的美梦中缓过来。要是美国那时候就全面进逼的话，后果还真的很难说。至少中国会丧失接下来10年的黄金发展机遇。 就在这个危急关头，另一个神奇的事情发生了——911事件。阿拉伯恐怖分子从侧面杀出来，一家伙撞了美国的世贸大楼。其实呢，世贸大楼被撞，美国的实际损失不算大，要是考虑到上千金融蛀虫提前见上帝，美国人实际上可能还省了不少钱。但从心理角度来说，这让安定了几十年，还沉浸在冷战胜利中的美国中产阶级人人自危。曼哈顿岛上的滚滚浓烟让美国人弄错了战略方向，本来已经伸向中国的拳头拐了个弯，去中东了。美国人先打阿富汗，再打伊拉克，对着伊朗挥舞一阵拳头后发现阿富汗还没有搞定，这一折腾就花了10年时间，上万亿美元。打仗要花钱，要养兵，美国人就自然更需要从中国购买工业品，更需要中国产品来支持摇摇欲坠的美元。于是中国工业继续指数化膨胀，甚至还有了资源重新搞产业升级。美国人唯一能做的就是趁着中东用兵，抬高","date":"2016-11-06","objectID":"/left-history/:1:3","series":["观点与评论","中国共产党与社会主义"],"tags":["马前卒","时政"],"title":"建国以来左右思潮的历史演变与民族叙事的构建","uri":"/left-history/#左翼同民族主义的联姻"},{"categories":["札录"],"content":" 左派的变化近年来左派第一个变化是仪式化。 10年前的左派，无论网上讨论还是网下聚会，大部分言论都是讨论具体问题的。至于讨论模式，倒不必太拘泥。现在有了网聊软件，聚会更方便了，我也经常参与一些左派网上聚会。内容暂且不论，我最受不了的是那种类似基督教会唱诗班的气氛。大部分聚会本身只有一个主题——赞颂毛泽东，花样翻新的赞颂，唱红歌、念诗篇、讲故事。好不容易抽点时间讨论现实问题，结果大家只需要两种表态——咒骂和赞颂，从来不需要辩证的思考，也没人去给出解决方案。我这个人死脑筋，总喜欢问具体问题，建议大家讨论一下刚刚咒骂过的那个问题到底该咋办，得到的答案往往是：“走毛主席的革命路线”。基督教有个话叫“因信称义”，即你要当“义人”，充分和必要条件都是信上帝。信了你就不用考虑别的细节了，唱赞美诗就行。现在的左派也喜欢这样。 必须承认，仪式化的东西好操作。中国古代总强调“以德治国”，实际下来都是“以礼治国”。就是因为“德”是个虚无缥缈的东西，必须搞一套既能让人有参与感，实际上又足够简单的东西来保证一个底线规则。但是呢，现在是21世纪，你谈政治，谈的是这个复杂的现实社会，总唱赞美诗算什么政治讨论？毛泽东的路线或许不错，但是具体操作方式呢？政治如果永远停留在原则性讨论，不涉及具体问题的处理方式。这样的政治讨论永远是空头政治，不可能。空头政治当然也有好处，比如说很容易就让参与者获得激情的刺激，也对现有的政治体制毫无威胁。如果那些自称的共产主义者觉得这就是他们想要的，我也只好说，随便吧，采取什么样的娱乐方式是他们的自由。但不要告诉别人这就是共产主义运动。 第二个变化是民族主义化。 当然，90年代末的时候，民族主义和左翼运动几乎完全不可区分。但现在的左翼运动，除了挂一个马列毛主义的壳，把文革和阶级二字习惯性地放在文章标题里之外，实质内容几乎全都是民族主义或者国家主义。最明显的例子，目前的左翼运动如果要攻击一个人，首先挂上的称号是“汉奸”，而不是“阶级敌人”。而左翼活动的内容，基本上就是声讨这些汉奸，以及背后的帝国主义老板。只要你骂汉奸——骂一个你都不知道存在不存在的人当然很容易，也没有心理负担——你就算是参与革命活动了。 一般来说，这个汉奸、买办主要指那些私营老板和一些自由派知识分子，再加上一些“潜伏”在政府内部的“资产阶级官僚”。除去这些人，剩下的就都是伟大的群众、可敬的领导核心。中国最重要的一个社会集团，即不打算当西方代理人的那些官僚，那些占有最多的中国社会资源和政治权力的集团，就这样被悄悄地划为了同志，至少也是同盟。 在许多左翼网站和左翼活动中，你可以看到大量的宣扬中国人相对外国人优越性的文章，即否认中国人和外国人是一种生物，拥有同样的权利。再进一步，宣扬汉民族主义的文章也能堂而皇之地在左翼内部得到一致叫好。这样一群人宣称自己在“推进共产主义”，实在很难让人理解极端民族主义对共产主义的必要性。 第三个变化是最重要的：去理论化。 左翼阵营从来是一个理论争吵不断的地方。这并不难理解，因为左翼一般来说会宣布自己受马克思主义指导，要把建设一个新社会作为大目标。既然要建设新社会，一切方案在没有落实之前，充分的讨论、辩论和争论都是必要的。天底下没有不需要修正的方案。但是，现在的左翼主流中，这种争论正在渐渐减少。因为大家渐渐的不去谈如何建设新社会了，剩下的只有怀旧与一致的攻击——对自由派。甚至有人开始怀疑马克思列宁理论的正确性——这其实是个好现象，不唯权威只唯真理，这本身没有什么问题。但是理由非常不可理喻——马克思和列宁是外国人，所以理论的可靠性不如本土的领袖。毛泽东的神性光环可以结束一切争论，同时也把一个政治运动变成一个安抚人的宗教。 去理论化不仅仅限于基本的政治思想和社会观点。在涉及到具体问题的时候，泛左翼的的思路也是一团糟。比如说现在左派阵营中最风行的“反转”，即对转基因的批判，大部分人根本不去讨论技术问题，直接声讨背后的“帝国主义势力”。我曾经认真地向几位左派同志请教，问他们到底转基因的害处如何详细论证。他们不是为我认真解答，而是立刻翻脸：“你问这是什么意思？你处于什么目的问这个问题？”。也有几位同志要热情一些，会让我去读某某人的书，但当我问他自己读没读过，关键点在何处，是否对书里的数据有自己归纳的的时候，人家还是拂袖而去，到别的QQ群里说刚刚碰到一个居心叵测的家伙。 总之，现在的左翼运动认为立场比事实和逻辑更重要。反转基因可以煽动反美的狂热性，在国内又没有真正树敌，所以只要指出转基因的技术来自美国，就足以证明这东西的邪恶性。因为方舟子支持转基因，所以方舟子就成了敌人。而方舟子的敌人就是盟友——肖传国也值得为之辩护。话说，不怕神一样的对手，就怕猪一样的盟友。主动捉头猪来当同盟，这种事还真少见。 当然了，去理论化背后颇有深意。左翼从根本上来说，是一个要求社会改革，矛头直指资产阶级的社会运动。所以任何深入的理论探讨，哪怕仅仅是对“共产主义”字面意思的探讨，也可能把运动的方向指向当政的官僚集团。所以，理论必须简化再简化，简化到像一根棍子那样，只有两头。足够简单的逻辑，可以把肖传国和一些中医骗子拉到自己一边，同样也可以把美国（西方）之外的社会集团描绘成同一个阵营。所以说，逻辑简单倒不一定意味着没有聪明人，或许有人聪明过头了。 第四个变化是体制化，完全可以说这其实是前三个变化的目的，同时也是原因。 迄今为止，左翼天生站在批判社会的一面。因为少数人占据社会大部分稀缺资源，少数人统治社会是几千年来的社会通例。左翼自称站在人民一边，自称要为大多数人建立理想的社会制度，自然有必要批判已有的一切社会制度。尤其是当前最主流的剥削制度。现在，全世界的工业国都已经从自由资本主义时代转向国家资本主义。按说左翼的批判矛头应该及时修正才是。但实际上，中国左翼现在还是集中火力批判自由资本主义，也就是那些“买办+代理人”。同时，在现政权越来越国家资本主义化的同时，左翼却开始逐渐对现政权产生认同，声称这是一个能带领共产主义者反对内外敌人（重点是“外”，内部的敌人都被解释为外部的代理），走向共产主义的先进集团。这不仅仅是认识不清的问题，完全是一种倒退。 90年代末、21世纪初的时候，随着文革被重新审视，以及苏联解体提供的教训，本来左翼内部已经逐渐对国家资本主义有了充分的认识，对中国官僚集团的行事方式和阶级地位有了明确的界定。但随着时间推移，左翼越活越回去了，开始为国家资本主义的“国进民退”而欢呼，说这是共产主义运动的伟大胜利。当年的左翼已经认识到现在的中共完全是一个资产阶级统治集团，今天却越来越多地看见左翼给这个统治集团写血书、诚心诚意地进谏。要求“党内健康力量”，带领我们走向共产主义。全国7000万党员，如果真有百分之一的“健康力量”，全国2000多个县区，每个县区也应该分到几百。我不知道那些逐渐转向拥护体制的左派到底见过几个党员兼共产主义者，以至于对这个党如此有信心。反正我是没见过。但无论如何，对现有执政集团的全面批判已经开始在左翼内部边缘化，甚至被指责为“偏执”、“妄想”。不过，要是连这一点偏执都没有，左翼还有什么脸面说自己是共产主义运动的一部分？ 公平的说，现在的主流左翼，并不是对整个官僚集团一味赞美的。对于党内一部分缺乏红色贵族背景的技术官僚，他们敢于大胆地影射、讽刺，甚至指名道姓地攻击。罪名则毫无例外地是：“买办”“汉奸”“走狗”。同时忘不了对另一派官僚集团的称颂。尤其是对“红二代”执政的赞美，用肉麻来形容已经有点不够了。这种夸一派骂一派的做法，本质上是政治投机。即认定中国的统治集团将越来越民族主义化、贵族化，希望使用西方化政治外壳的官僚将日趋衰微。因此，提前选择赢面大的一方下注会有较大利益。甚至在某些情况下，这个政治投机本身连“投机”都算不上，完全就是当局宣传部门的一个外包项目。到此，官僚集团应该很满意，因为90年代在城市中下层人口中很有影响力的泛左翼阵营，大部分已经成为了政权的维稳工具。最近，重庆公布了36首红歌的名单，第一首是《走向复兴》。号称要鼓舞共产主义理想的歌曲中，没有《国际歌》。这正是今天主流左翼的写照。 这个群体的变化，不仅我感受到了，那些“正牌”的民族主义者，或者说从一开始就不谈什么阶级斗争和共产主义的民族主义者也感受到了。我的朋友里就颇有不少这样的人，眼里从来只有中华民族（汉族）帝国的伟大与光荣，从来不在乎这个帝国是什么样的统治方式，只要能让中国在世界上称王称霸，照搬美国制度也好，纳粹也罢，都无所谓。在政治光谱上，这显然是极右派。前几年，这批人谈起乌有之乡的时候，满嘴都是不屑，说那里都是一群喜欢造谣的疯子。但在那些民族主义者朋友看来，乌有之乡这几年是越来越“进步”了。评价从“满是疯话”变成了“脑袋开始清楚起来”。其实，客观来说，不论是前几年还是现在，乌有之乡的确都有喜欢耸人听闻的毛病，对文章的可靠度审查不严。但是呢，这个毛病最近几年是愈演愈烈的。前几年最多是传点花边新闻，近几年就干脆赤裸裸的使用谣言。这样一个网站之所以被极右翼认为“疯话”少了，少的显然不是真正的不靠谱文章，而是少了阶级斗争、共产主义理想这些“疯”话。 在乌有之乡常开讲座的，还有杨帆这一类纯粹的技术流民族主义，他们和我的那几个民族主义朋友差不多，也是只说国家不说阶级，只说民族主义不提共产主义的。前几年，他们常在乌有之乡演讲，被冠以“左派”的名头。对于这个名头，这个群体不约而同地表示了拒绝，杨帆曾经公开表态：“我不是左派”。原因是当时的泛左翼和请他们开讲座的乌有之乡还经常谈阶级斗争，谈革命。所以他们觉得自己决不能挂上这个名头。 最近几年，我再次听到“我不是左派！”这句话。不过发言者不再是那些民族主义者，而是一些坚持和中","date":"2016-11-06","objectID":"/left-history/:1:4","series":["观点与评论","中国共产党与社会主义"],"tags":["马前卒","时政"],"title":"建国以来左右思潮的历史演变与民族叙事的构建","uri":"/left-history/#左派的变化"},{"categories":["札录"],"content":" 后记今天的中国，老百姓开始习惯说自由主义的名词。这在民族主义看来是一种威胁，我却觉得这是社会进步的机遇。随着教育和媒体的普及，越来越多的老百姓不满足于简单的政治牢骚，已经在“后革命时代”重新意识到谈论政治、推动政治变革是自己的权利，也是解决大部分社会问题的根本方案，这本是大时代的先声。面对这种机遇，左翼主流不是积极应对，向人民普及正确的政治思考方式，反而回头抱住红色贵族的大腿，为最保守、最反动的权力世袭制度奔走鼓吹。用一句很古老的话：“自绝于人民”来形容再合适不过。 这年头是个“后革命时代”，共产主义者早就不时髦了，中国谈共产主义的也不止我一个。但是，谈共产主义，必然要搞清楚什么是共产主义，至少要知道贵族集团、官僚专政和共产主义绝不相容。很多人看着共产主义是个笑话，我不怕被人笑，但我们搞共产主义，绝不能被共产主义的敌人利用了还笑我们傻逼。这是我个人划定的一条底线。 https://review.youngchina.org/archives/2892 ↩︎

汪洋：iPad、网络问政与财产公开「一个好制度比好领导更重要。要靠制度来保证听取民意。」 这段话，是中共中央政治局委员﹑广东省委书记汪洋，在广州珠岛宾馆和二十六位互联网网友的座谈会上说的。出席座谈会的网友本来担心发言内容会受限制，但汪洋一开始就说：「你今天仍然可以『放肆』，否则就没有个性了。」疑虑一扫而空，大家畅所欲言。汪洋在发言中，对中国的互联网民主作出系统论述，指出根据十七大「拓宽民主渠道」、「扩大公民有序的政治参与」的精神，中国要构建充满活力、和谐有序、建设性的网络民主平台；要充分发挥网络的积极作用，推动网络民主发展。1 到会的网友谈的问题非常尖锐，有人直指当地干群（干部与群眾）关係紧张，广东政府部门财务报表不透明，人大代表都看不懂，更有网友则拿出温度计指会场空调温度太低，不符合国家规定。五年前，咼中校曾因为《深圳，你被谁拋弃》的网文与时任深圳市长于幼军对话，这次向汪洋提问：思想解放的重点在干部，但是现在领导干部对待改革的心态普遍是「寧可保守一点，而不愿进取一点」，因为改革风险大，在这种情况下，广东如何打破领导干部的「寧守勿进」心态？汪洋没有直接回答，但在其后讲话中说出了他需要的答案。那就是，汪洋举起「互联网民主」这面旗帜，充分肯定体制外的积极声音，显然是要让体制外的声音通过网络发挥作用，对党员干部產生体制内外的压力，让他们的改革与施政更广泛地接受监督和检验，这无疑是推动思想解放的一大高招。2 2009年4月，广东省委书记汪洋主动与12名民间人士对话，这些平日习惯上网发帖的“意见领袖”有了与省委书记直接对话的机会。之后，“南方民间智库”应运而生，政府和网民间有了更有效的交流平台，网络问政提升到更深层次。从2008年至今，汪洋已经五年五会网友。无论是鼓励“放肆”发言，还是“允许群众骂娘”，汪洋对待网络意见的开放态度得到媒体广泛认可。在今年8月发表在《求是》的文章中，汪洋指出，创设网络视频信访平台，积极拓展网络问政，这是社会主义民主法治的有效形式之一。3 5月14日，十一届中共广东省委常委与网民在线交流会今天上午10时在广东省委大院一号楼召开。汪洋说：今天是新一届常委任职履责的第一天，我们集体做的第一件事就是一起来与网友进行在线交流。省委常委徐少华同志因参加中央领导同志在外地的活动以外，其余的同志全部参加了。我们想以这种方式表达省委对广东网络社会的重视。广东有一亿人口，其中有6300多万网民，无论是这次党代会的筹备、召开，还是在广东日常的改革、发展、稳定的工作中，广大网民都给我们提出了许多的意见、建议，有鼓励、支持，当然也少不了批评。我们认为这都是对我们工作的关注、帮助，让我们兼听则明，让我们谨慎自省，也使我们头脑清醒，不断改进工作。我们新一届省委常委对广大网民表示衷心的感谢！4 广东省委书记汪洋表示，广东向来重视网民意见，新的省委常委集体与网民交流，就是要倾听来自于网络的真实的声音，无论是批评还是鼓励，都可以谨慎自省，头脑清醒并不断改进工作。他说，“省委领导集体这样做更多的是示范效应，是鼓励我们各级党委、政府和广大领导干部更注意来自于网络的声音，因为在这个平台上大家可以更大胆、更直率、更尖锐地对执政者提出意见，可以使我们真正做到兼听则明。即使听到一些骂我们的声音，也可以使我们更加清醒。”5 汪洋说：“我们必须破除人民幸福是党和政府恩赐的错误认识。”汪洋是人们认为比较活跃的“封疆大吏”之一，广东经常有些吸引人们眼球的新动作。广东正在搞老百姓最关心的“干部财产申报”的试点。最近，汪洋又在全省党的代表大会上讲话，指出：“人民群众是创造历史的主体，……追求幸福，是人民的权利；造福人民，是党和政府的责任。我们必须破除人民幸福是党和政府恩赐的错误认识。”作为一位党的重要领导干部，广东省的一把手，能发出这样人们多年来听不到的针砭积弊的声音，殊为难得。多年散布“人民幸福是党和政府恩赐”这种不符合马克思主义唯物史观的错误认识，是一些宣传部门的多年强化教育的结果，更是与党内有些人对被人民感谢觉得很舒服、很受用分不开。但如果不是汪洋，而是别人说这个话，也许会招来什么无妄之灾，没准儿会有人请你喝茶，追问你对党和政府是什么态度。其实不管是中国还是外国，一个政府或者一个政党给人民办点好事，实在是应该的，做出了危害人民的事情，是应该道歉的，长时间陶醉于人民的感谢和歌颂之中是一种低级趣味。现在由汪洋出面把这个多年颠倒的是非重新颠倒过来，虽说是恢复了一个常识，还是有振聋发聩之功。让我们兴奋得奔走相告：“这回2+2=4也可以公开说啦？这思想也太解放了！”更重要的是，党和人民都有机会重新思索一下自身的位置如何摆放才算正确，这对党的前途和命运意义也十分重大。3 昨天晚上，现代快报(微博)记者联系到照片中的南方电视台记者肖琳。肖琳介绍说，昨天广东召开省委全会，会议地点在白云国际会展中心。下午分组讨论结束之后，参加会议的代表陆续离开。当时南方电视台的几位记者、摄像在会场外编辑片子，准备发回台里。大约17：50不到的时候，汪洋从会场内走出来。肖琳介绍说：“当时我们正在讨论片子的问题，不知道书记还没离开，见他走出来便与他打招呼。”随后，汪洋便走到他们的笔记本电脑前，问起了他们正在做什么。得知两位记者正在编片子后，汪洋又与他们聊起了编辑设备。肖琳和万荣介绍说，现在通过笔记本电脑就能编辑传输片子，非常方便。汪洋又问笔记本电脑是否能达到电视直播的效果，他们回答说笔记本电脑还不能取代直播车，目前能达到的效果是快速发稿。随后，汪洋又问了一下正在编辑的片子会关注哪些方面，打算发什么样的画面等等。肖琳介绍，汪洋与他们聊天的过程大约十分钟，摄像叶剑就是当时用手机拍摄后直接传到微博上。肖琳说：“书记晚上还有会，离开的时候跟会展中心的工作人员说了一句‘还有时间，去吃饭吧’。”肖琳告诉现代快报记者，她以前也跟汪洋接触过很多次，但是这次与汪洋的对话是意料之外的一次，也是很轻松的一次。就在本月初，汪洋在与网友交流时说：“我是用iPad，是因为我觉得这种先进的科学技术成果对我的工作提高效率非常有帮助。不是因为iPad的时尚，而是因为它实用我才用它。”肖琳猜测，也许汪洋会在微博上看到自己的这张照片。6 十八大代表团开放日，广东省委书记汪洋在回答有关官员财产申报的问题时表示，广东也在试点官员财产申报制度，我们会继续探索。7

俞正声：多党制、独立候选人和党的合法性十八大上海代表团开放日。在回答记者提问时，上海市委书记俞正声表示，要逐步实行财产公开制度。在制度上建立一套完备的、便于群众监督的办法，才是管好自己的亲属和身边工作人员最有效的途径。对于是否会带头公开财产的问题，俞正声表示，只要中央决定，自己很容易公开，“因为我没有多少财产”。党的十八大上，官员财产公开成为舆论关注的一大焦点，而面对舆论关切，无论是俞正声还是汪洋都未回避。从两位高官的表态可以看出，上海、广东都已试点官员财产申报制度，并将逐步实行财产公开制度。犹记得在去年的全国两会上，新疆自治区党委书记张春贤就曾表示：“对财产公示，你们知道我的态度。我现在告诉大家，第一，我已经按照中央现有的规定，如实填报我自己的有关情况；第二，如果将来需要向全社会公布财产的话，只要有这个制度设计，我会率先公布我所有财产。”很显然，高官对财产公开越来越脱敏，也敢于公开财产。这次上海、广东等地集中谈及官员财产公开，再次说明了官员直面舆论呼声的自觉，也凸显出官员财产公开的必要和重要。众所周知，官员财产公开被称为“阳光法案”，是举世公认的反腐利器。不实行官员财产公开制度，就会有更多的“房叔”潜伏，甚至神不知鬼不觉地将财产转移到国外；不实行官员财产公开制度，公众的知情权、参与权、表达权和监督权就无法很好地实现；不实行官员财产公开制度，腐败就很难有效遏制。问题的关键还在于，官员公开财产是义务，如果财产合法，没什么不敢公开的。日前，湖南省常德市汉寿县政法委副书记张天成在微博上，将自己和家人的财产一一公示，并表示，“我觉得这个没有敢不敢的问题，公布财产并不是很难的事情”，“问题在于财产的来源合法与否，如果都是合法的，有什么公布不得的呢？”而俞正声则表示，只要中央决定，公开财产很容易。他还曾表示，“我的财产早就申报了。这次，中央是扩大申报范围，要求申报住房、配偶子女工作等情况。我们按照规定每年如实申报。如果可能的话，你可以去中纪委查查。”这是一种坦然。越来越多的官员愿意公开财产，这是好事，直面民意胜过闪烁其词，公开财产胜过默不作声。8 2011年6月20日下午，一堂特别的党课在上海交通大学新体育馆内进行──坐在讲台上的，是身着白衬衫的中央政治局委员、上海市委书记俞正声。这并不是一场枯燥乏味或是充满宣传动员辞令的演说。这堂近两个小时的党课上，俞正声不仅主动谈起了五四运动、新中国建立、“文革”等时期的争议话题，还毫不避讳地触及一些社会敏感问题，并不时以自己的故事现身说法，现场掌声笑声不断。俞正声选择到上海交大上党课，却要从一条最近网上热议的微博说起。 5月中旬，在上海交大国际与公共事务学院大四学生党支部的一次组织生活会上，一位同学分享了在微博上看到的一则“冷笑话”──一个女大学生来公司面试，经理看了看简历抬头问她：你是党员？那个女生顿时紧张了起来，激动地说：党员也有好人啊！支部书记董雪告诉南方周末记者，围绕这条微博，支部内进行了一场信仰危机的讨论。讨论后，大家决定把“无论何时何地，亮出党员身份”作为这个支部毕业之前最后一次党课的主题。这个主题针对的是当前的社会现状──“现在很多同学对自己的党员身份主观上蛮淡漠的，不会主动说自己是党员，当有一些是非争辩的时候，他们也不愿意亮出自己的党员身份，表明自己应该持有的立场。”董雪说。最后，支部决定向学校里其他毕业支部乃至社会发起“亮出党员身份”的倡议。在老师的帮助下，他们也给俞正声写了一封倡议信。有意思的是，两年之前，刚到上海履任不久的俞正声，也曾到复旦大学上过一次“党课”。那一堂主题为“坚定党的信念、坚持党员本分”的党课，也是“结缘”于一封毕业生的来信。 俞正声走进了体育馆。“交流是为了讲心里话，念稿子大家不爱听……我今天给大家上党课……没有教育人的意思。”向来不用讲稿的俞正声，这次也不例外，这番开场白先赢得了大学生们的掌声。俞正声——这位党的高级干部说，现在是一个开放的社会，有的书国内没怎么出，也会从各种渠道流入国内。怎么样在复杂的社会环境中间保持一种政治上的坚定性，“是一件不容易的事情”。 随后，以中共历史为脉络，俞正声给学生谈了几个“怎么看”。他说，“现在有的媒体宣传的一种观点，认为五四运动以后，北洋军阀丧失一点控制，中国出现了资本主义发展的最好时机。很可惜的是，救亡图存的思想，使中国丧失了一个资本主义民主发展的机遇，从而陷入了革命的漩涡。”俞正声说，“报纸上当然没点共产党，但是说救亡图存的思想下，民主共和发展的大好局面被破坏了。”俞正声说，“我是在哪儿看到这种言论的？是在我们上海的报纸上，而且是转载的北京的报纸。”对于这个问题，俞正声举了自己4月在《新华文摘》看到的一篇文章为例。该文谈到，1920年，死亡人数超过20万人的宁夏海原大地震，地震后一个月当地政府才向北洋政府上报了求救信息，得到的捐款也极有限。“我到上海以后，感觉很多人对上海的 (上个世纪)30年代很留恋。30年代上海是金融中心，全国的文化中心；另一方面，上海是沙漠中的绿洲。20年代上海已经发展了，上海为海原大地震做了什么？上海的富商们为海原大地震贡献了什么？”在俞正声看来：“五四时代就是一个救亡图存的时代……不能仅仅看到大学里的一些景象就做出一个对社会的判断。” 俞正声强调，在这种时代特点下，中共诞生，就是要为劳苦大众打天下，就是不能让社会、官僚们熟视无睹群众死活的状况在中国继续下去，所以才产生了共产党。“有人说解放战争的胜利是军事的胜利，中国共产党军事上比国民党高，我觉得是不对的，根本上是人民群众的拥护和支持。”俞正声随后谈到农民参加土改。“有的同志说，土改就是农村里的痞子，把地主的财产分了，乱打乱杀，这个现在很多文章里面讲过的，有没有这种情况？有！但是，我们党的历史上在土改中乱打乱杀的结果，必然导致这个地区群众的反水，这不是没有发生过的，抗战时期也发生了。但是为什么那么多群众拥护解放军和拥护共产党呢？从根本上说，土改运动是得人心的，是得到群众的拥护和支持的。” 第三是怎么看待“社会主义建设艰难的探索”。俞正声坦言，“文化大革命”是一场灾难，这不光是毛泽东的个人错误，也是党的错误。他回忆说：“文化大革命期间，我母亲(注：范瑾，曾长期从事新闻及宣传工作，是北京日报报业集团的奠基人，其兄是著名历史学家范文澜，丈夫是曾出任建国后第一任天津市市长和第一机械工业部部长的黄敬)1966年被打倒，1968年蹲监狱，1975年回来，出来之后我就感觉她精神上不正常了，老有被迫害的感觉。一直到前年她去世，都拒绝做任何体检。我的妹妹，“文革”开始时一个高中生，在学校里被批斗，后来也得了精神分裂症，自杀了。我们亲属在‘文革’中死去的，有六七人。”“那么为什么对毛主席还基本上是一个正面的肯定态度？他有很严重的错误，为什么？我个人认为，第一，他的著作、他的思想影响了许许多多的人，包括我，我对毛主席是非常尊敬的，虽然他犯了这么大的错误。正因为如此，很多人就千方百计地诋毁他，甚至说，毛主席著作大部分是胡乔木写的，胡说八道，胡乔木写不出这种文章来。第二个，我认为他搞文化大革命，是真真切切地感觉到，我们国家不能简单地发展生产，要防止新生资产阶级的出现，防止工人农民重新沦为社会的底层，他的动机是无可厚非的。”俞正声说，“但是他寻找的道路是错的……现在的很多事情也证明他的担心不是没有理由。但是，不能因为这种担心而寻找一种错误的道路。” “30年来国家有很大进步，但现在也面临着很多新的问题。”俞正声一一数道。比较突出的，一是收入分配差距拉大，现在银行高管一年薪水几百万，有的银行，老总一年可以几千万，“而上海的最低工资线是一个月一千两三百块，这可是几百上千倍的差距”。“还有党内的腐败现象，我看没有从根本上进行遏制，最近报的铁道部部长的案子，利用工程索取钱财，成亿成亿地索取，若干亿的回扣，生活糜烂啊。”此外，俞正声还谈到了当前社会矛盾不断地涌现。他说，“有一些社会矛盾是属于干部处理经验不足，没有在早发阶段赶紧处置；有一些社会矛盾是越渲染越大，本来没那么大。”“第三，还有我们工作的不足和体制的缺陷。”俞以分配问题为例，他说，邓小平1993年就讲过，分配问题可能比解决发展的问题还难，应该在本世纪末、下世纪初把这个问题尖锐地提出来，鼓励用各种方法去进行探索。“我想我们对小平方针的认识和实践上做得不够。”“此外，干部的监管使用上还有制度性的缺陷。”俞正声顿了一下说，“这个我就不多讲了。”不过俞正声告诉听众，按照中央政治局委员标准，他每个月工资一万一，“不算高也不算低”，比上海市市长韩正低一些。“抽烟是自己买，衣服也是按照市场价格买。”俞正声也提醒说，(解决当前问题)不能急于求成，不能采取“文革”的办法来解决干部的腐败问题。“我们建国以来的教训是什么，是急于求成，以前是跑步进入共产主义，现在是GDP赛跑，所以才有那么大的投资、那么大的货币量。”“我们总要找到新的途径和办法，就是靠各方监督的办法。”他甚至举了个自己的例子，他去年10月去崇明检查工作，结束后随行人员邀请他去看看当地一个湖。当时，大量游客在那，俞正声一行至少有四五辆车就开上去了，然后上了船。俞说，从船上下来，游客就跟他打招呼。“第一句是，俞书记好；第二句就是，你买票了没有？我赶紧让秘书把票补了。”这段自嘲，也引得学生一阵大笑。因此，“还是要扩大公开，置于群众与社会的监督之下，这方面我们总要找一种制度性突破，扩大群众和社会的监督”。 “有的同志说，党是不是代表了某些利益阶层，就要维护这个阶层的利益，换句话说，当官的要维护当官的利益。”俞正声说，“党必须代表大多数人的利益，党不是利益群体。共产党不是一个利益集团，它是能够反映各种意见的","date":"2015-01-01","objectID":"/zztz/:2:0","series":["社科","人物","⭐️5"],"tags":["王沪宁","政治"],"title":"互联网时代的政治体制思考：党和国家领导人的视角","uri":"/zztz/#俞正声多党制独立候选人和党的合法性"},{"categories":["札录"],"content":" 韩正：城市治理、外媒与网络信息源10记者：韩正先生，如果我没有记错的话，今年你60岁。 韩正：60整。 记者：今年60岁，在我见过的中国高层官员当中，你显得非常年轻。 韩正：实际不年轻。 记者：想问一下，管理上海，一个两千四百万人的大城市，什么感觉？有没有晚上睡不着的时候？ 韩正：始终是感觉到很大的压力，晚上睡不好觉是经常的。当你晚上接到一个电话，报告某一件事情。晚上十点后，给我的电话，无非就是两种情况。一种是特好消息，一种是不太好的消息。特好消息，一年也就一两次，不多。基本上都是不好的消息。哪儿出了事故，哪里又发生了紧急情况。我觉得作为上海这样的特大城市来讲，我们作为管理者，任何细节都不能放过。更重要的是这个城市运行的每一个细节，必须执行精细化的管理，这一条我很关注。 我们更关注什么？很坦率地说，譬如今天和你们谈国际经济中心、金融中心、贸易中心、航运中心，还有创新中心，这个当然是大目标。对我们城市管理者来讲，更多研究的是细节。细节是什么？比如，环境如何进一步优化，林荫大道怎么建，水环境怎么治理，空气环境刚才我们讲了。环境治理上，能够更美好一点。还有社会能不能更公平一点。经济高速发展后，我们确实存在一些不公平的现象。现在按照习近平总书记对我们提出的要求，要社会公平，使低收入的收入高一点。现在有一个词，叫幸福感。什么叫幸福感？ 幸福感讲不清楚。有人唱一首歌就很幸福；老年人，老有所养，老有所乐，他就很幸福；蜗居的，他有一套新房，他很幸福；生了病的，能够找到好医生，他很幸福；家庭里面有孩子读书了，千方百计上一个好学校，就很幸福。让这座城市的老百姓都有幸福感，这是我们城市管理者最大的心愿。 记者：你刚才提到老百姓，他们有很多的愿望要表达。我想知道一下，平时你通过什么渠道，来获取你作为一个市委书记应该知道的信息？ 韩正：我的信息源很广泛。可以跟你说的是，国内和全球的资讯，每一天我都会花一定时间去看。我有团队把全球和全国的内容，批评我们的，表扬我们的，批评韩书记的，表扬韩书记的，都让我们知道，特别是批评意见。 记者：批评你的，你的团队不会扣下来？ 韩正：扣不下来的。网上都有。 韩正：当然，我也会通过各种渠道，直接听老百姓的意见。我会经常接触一些社区居民，上海的企业家，在上海的外资和央企的企业家，接触一些老师，大学老师，中学老师。我在上海工作很久，他们跟我很熟，见到我什么话都讲，没有客套话，都是讲直白话。我也会通过我的团队、各种渠道，包括他们的微信和微博，实际上就像我的微信微博一样。他们会告诉我，所以我有各种渠道，当然我们还有民间的渠道、信访者的渠道，人大代表的渠道，政协委员的渠道，使我们每时每刻都可以了解情况。每天早晨，我到办公室的第一件事，就是看我的团队为我整理的全世界网络和全国所有媒体今早报道的主要内容。是浓缩的，高度浓缩的，我不可能自己去搜索。我的团队会帮我收集相关的内容。 记者：听说你上网的时间不少？每天在网上花多少时间？ 韩正：这有两种情况。一种是我们的公务网，也叫内网。现在我们全靠网络办公了。我看文件，查资料，甚至我现在看到东西要批示一些东西，都是看到以后下载，再批文的。 记者：打印后，再批。 韩正：我办公室直接打印出来了。 记者：就是大部分无纸化处理？ 韩正：无纸化办公。我在工作间歇，中午期间，每天会花很多时间在互联网上，自己搜索信息。搜索信息，无非就是自己感兴趣的各种资讯。 记者：每天上网，有几个小时吗？ 韩正：起码要两、三个小时。到家以后，睡觉以前，再上上网。上海的官员，睡觉都是在下半夜，12点以后，所以自己要干点事情，要上网搜索，都是十点后比较太平的时候，没有电话干扰。 记者：你刚才提到，你手下这些助手的微信微博也是你的。你自己也“潜水”吧？ 韩正：微博，我“潜水”。微信，我现在没有设立个人账号。 记者：我不会问你“潜水”的账号。你每天花很多时间查各种各样的资讯？是不是意味着，有时候，你也“翻墙”？ 韩正：每天早晨，有关全世界的资讯都到我办公室了。有的甚至是很尖锐的批评意见，他们就直接转给我。 记者：最近半年时间，作为市委书记，你对新媒体，对上海媒体改革投入很多时间，相当关注。你对新媒体、网络媒体到底怎么看？ 韩正：网络媒体是一个好东西。但是，看你到底怎么用。当今社会，未来的社会，离开网络是不可思议的，我和我的团队们一起研究，今天我们对网络的认知只是很少一部分。未知远远大于已知。我觉得，对互联网这种新媒体，如果你不关注，你就根本无法开展工作，就没有发言权。你看纸媒，纸媒我也是都看的。看纸媒了解的信息，完全不能全覆盖。网络，是可以全覆盖的，且无处不在，无时不在，特别代表着未来的年轻一代。他们对网络的这种痴迷、爱好，痴迷到好像比自己的爱人还要离不开。这种痴迷的程度，如果不了解，我们就会被淘汰。所以，我觉得新媒体发展是趋势，作为一个承担了一定领导职务的官员，你必须高度关注新媒体的发展，新媒体的应用，和新媒体每时每刻的变化。你讲得不错，我和他们讨论最多的就是新媒体，关注最多的也是新媒体，和家人讨论最多的也是新媒体。 记者：上海纸媒的总编辑们，就有点失落了？ 韩正：纸媒永远都会存在的。我们现在纸媒和新媒体结合了，融合发展。

蔡奇：官员上网、互联网监督与决策透明化从1999年调任浙江省衢州市委副书记、市长开始，蔡奇在浙江官场为官15年，曾担任过浙江台州市委书记、杭州市长、浙江省委组织部部长等要职。履历正统的他，在浙江任职期间，曾是名“资深网红”。作为全国首个拥有百万“粉丝”的省部级官员，蔡奇堪称“微博达人”，创造了微博“蔡式风格”，他给自己的标签是“布尔什维克”、“创业导师”、“老童鞋”、“苹果控”。蔡奇被网友称呼为“蔡叔”。 2010年5月，蔡奇开通实名政务微博，半年后，通过实名认证。当时，浙江省省委常委的身份使他成为地方官员中，公开开设微博中行政级别最高的一位。据媒体报道，蔡奇的腾讯微博的账号听众达到1030多万。蔡奇在微博中写道：“官员开博的本意是融入社会。拥有的粉丝及转发越多，表明社会对你的认可程度越高。”蔡奇曾公开倡导其同僚和下属开通微博。他说，“官员要走进玻璃房，接受监督”。在蔡奇的影响下，2011年两会期间浙江省有几十名官员开设了实名微博。自开通微博以来，内容几乎每天更新，日均广播数近12条。 2012年，蔡奇曾在知名财经媒体——财新上写过专栏，内容涉及工作、生活、旅游等多方面。其中有一篇题为“官员上网要经得起‘拍砖’”，文中指出：“开实名微博，怎样处理好职务和个人关系？我认为要有所区分，但也不能太较真。一些人一旦开了实名微博，怕这怕那、束手束脚，一点积极性都没有。都是抄文件的微博谁看？微博还是要有个性的东西、自己的话语。大家愿意看到官员的另一面。我认为，官员微博也要坚持几个原则：保密的不能讲，不该讲的不能讲，上班不能发，不要和别人打口水仗。”2013年蔡奇的一条微博互动一时成为热点，9月14日晚，浙江一母亲在微博求助时任浙江省委组织部部长蔡奇，称在国税局工作的儿子不能喝酒，却常陪领导喝酒。15日晚，蔡奇转发该微博并喊话：“告诉我你儿子在国税哪个单位？今后可以不用喝酒了。”据采访过或见过他本人的媒体人士向21世纪经济报道透露，蔡奇为人低调儒雅、处事稳重。21世纪经济报道发现，知乎还有个简介为“浙江省委组织部长”的“蔡奇”用户，更新至2011年，其回答普遍简明扼要幽默风趣。31日，蔡奇任北京市代市长的消息公开后，时隔五年此条问答下面居然又有了多条新的回复。
